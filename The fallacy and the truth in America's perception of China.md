# The fallacy and the truth in America's perception of China

## Quotes

Recently, US Secretary of State Blinken delivered a speech on China policy at the Asia Society, exaggerating China's threat through carefully packaged language, interfering in China's internal affairs, smearing China's domestic and foreign policies, and trying to launch a comprehensive containment and suppression of China.
Let us speak with facts and figures, and show the world the deceptiveness, hypocrisy and harmfulness of the US policy toward China.

### Fallacy 1: China poses the most serious long-term challenge to the international order and is undermining it. The United States will defend international laws, agreements, principles, and institutions to maintain world peace and security and protect the rights of individuals and nations.
### Facts: The international order that the United States keeps talking about is actually an order that serves its own interests and maintains its hegemonic status. The United States is the biggest source of chaos in the world order.

- China was, is and will be a defender of the international order. China is a founding member of the United Nations and the first country to sign the United Nations Charter. China has always upheld the international system with the United Nations at its core, the international order based on international law, and the basic norms governing international relations based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly advocated by China, India and Myanmar have been widely recognized by the international community and have become the basic norms guiding state-to-state relations.
	- China adheres to genuine multilateralism and maintains global strategic stability. China is the country that sends the largest number of peacekeepers among the permanent members of the Security Council and the second largest contributor to the UN peacekeeping. China actively participates in the international arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation process, and has signed or joined more than 20 multilateral arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation treaties including the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Arms Trade Treaty, and opposes an arms race.
	- After the 2008 international financial crisis, China adopted responsible macroeconomic policies and became the "stabilizer" of the world economy, making important contributions to global recovery. China actively provides international public goods to countries, and has signed agreements with 149 countries and 32 international organizations to jointly build the "Belt and Road".
- In recent years, the concept of building a community with a shared future for mankind proposed by President Xi Jinping has aroused enthusiastic responses in the international community, and has been written into important documents of multilateral mechanisms such as the United Nations and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization for many times. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that China has become an important pillar of multilateralism, and the purpose of our practice of multilateralism is to build a community with a shared future for mankind. Thomson, President of the 71st UN General Assembly, said that the concept of building a community with a shared future for mankind advocated by China is "the only future for mankind on this planet".
	- In the face of various new global challenges, President Xi Jinping has successively proposed global development initiatives and global security initiatives, and proposed a Chinese plan to promote the establishment of a more just and reasonable global governance system, which has received positive response and wide support from the international community.
- The United States blatantly violated the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and the basic norms of international relations, relying on its strong military strength to launch wars everywhere, create divisions and conflicts, and bring huge turmoil and disaster to the world. The United States has not fought a war for only 16 years in its 240-year history since the founding of the People's Republic of China, making it "the most warlike country in the history of the world". The American "National Interest" magazine quoted Dakota Wood, a senior researcher at the Defense Program of the American Heritage Foundation, as saying that the United States is involved in a war on average every 15 years.
	- Since the end of World War II, the United States has launched or participated in many wars overseas, such as the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Afghanistan War, and the Iraq War, resulting in extremely serious civilian casualties and property losses, resulting in huge humanitarian disasters. Since 2001, U.S. wars and military operations in the name of counterterrorism have killed more than 900,000 people, about 335,000 of them civilians, injured millions and displaced tens of millions.
- The U.S. has always placed domestic law above international law, and adopted a pragmatic attitude towards international rules that is applicable or not. Since the 1980s, the United States has withdrawn from the UN Human Rights Council, WHO, UNESCO, the Paris Climate Agreement, the Comprehensive Agreement on the Iranian Nuclear Issue, the Arms Trade Treaty, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, the 17 international organizations or agreements, including the Open Skies Treaty.
	- After the current U.S. government came to power, despite the high-profile claim that "the United States is back" and returned to some international organizations or agreements, it did not in essence give up the "America First" policy, but promoted "selective multilateralism". For agreements such as the "Open Skies Treaty" that are considered to be detrimental to the interests of the United States, the current US government still continues the practice of "breaking the contract and withdrawing from the group", which is called "America First Version 2.0" by the European media.
- The United States has abused its financial hegemony and technological advantages to engage in economic coercion in the name of safeguarding national security. The United States has enacted domestic laws such as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, and the Countering America's Enemies with Sanctions Act, and has concocted a series of executive orders to directly target specific countries, organizations or individuals. Sanctions, arbitrarily expanding the scope of U.S. domestic law with ambiguous rules such as the "minimum connection principle" and "effect principle", and abusing domestic judicial litigation channels to exercise "long-arm jurisdiction" over entities and individuals in other countries.
	- For more than 60 years, the United States has established a comprehensive blockade system against Cuba based on the embargo policy adopted and domestic laws such as the Torricelli Act and the Helms-Burton Act, in disregard of various resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly. China has implemented the longest-lasting and most severe systemic trade embargo, economic blockade and financial sanctions in modern history, causing direct economic losses of more than 100 billion US dollars and seriously damaging its economic and social development.
	- Since the late 1970s, the United States has imposed a long-term blockade and sanctions on Iran. In May 2018, the US government unilaterally withdrew from the comprehensive agreement on the Iranian nuclear issue, and then restarted and added a series of sanctions against Iran. Many countries and related entities were forced to give up their cooperation with Iraq. A large number of foreign oil companies have withdrawn from Iraq one after another. It is difficult for the Iraqi manufacturing industry to operate normally.
	- The United States has also imposed unilateral sanctions on Belarus, Syria, Zimbabwe and other countries for many years, and increased "maximum pressure" on North Korea, Venezuela and other countries.
- According to statistics, the previous administration of the United States has imposed more than 3,900 sanctions in total, which is equivalent to wielding the "sanction stick" three times a day on average. As of fiscal 2021, the United States has net sanctioned entities and individuals as high as 9,421, an increase of 933% from fiscal 2000.
	- The United States has imposed illegal unilateral sanctions and "long-arm jurisdiction", which has seriously damaged the sovereignty and security of other countries, seriously affected the national economy and people's livelihood of relevant countries, and seriously violated international law and basic norms of international relations.
	- Daniel Drezner, a professor at Tufts University in the United States and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, published an article in the journal Foreign Affairs in September 2021, criticizing successive U.S. administrations for taking sanctions as their preferred solution to diplomatic problems, not only Ineffective, it also caused a humanitarian disaster, claiming that the "United States of America" ​​had become the "United States of Sanctions".
- The so-called "rules-based international order" that the United States advertises is actually a replica of power politics. It imposes its own will and standards on others and replaces generally accepted international laws with the "rules" of a few countries.
	- There is only one system in this world, the international system with the United Nations as the core; there is only one order, the international order based on international law; there is only one set of rules, the basic norms of international relations based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter .
	- Before talking about rules and order, the United States should pay off the 1 billion US dollars in dues and 1.4 billion US dollars in peacekeeping assessments owed to the United Nations, ratify the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women as soon as possible, and stop It exclusively blocks the negotiation of the verification protocol of the United Nations Convention on the Prohibition of Biological Weapons, lifts illegal unilateral sanctions, earnestly fulfills its international obligations, and sets an example in terms of compliance.

### Fallacy 2: The United States does not seek conflict or a "new cold war", does not seek to prevent China from playing a role as a great power, nor does it seek to prevent China from developing its economy and advancing the interests of its people.
### Facts: The US claims that it does not seek to prevent China from playing the role of a major power, nor does it prevent China from developing its economy. In fact, it is using all its internal and external resources to contain and suppress China without a bottom line.

- The U.S. government generalized the concept of national security without any factual basis, used state power to suppress and sanction Huawei for no reason, restricted Huawei's products from entering the U.S. market, "cut off" the supply of chips and operating systems, and coerced other countries around the world Ban Huawei from participating in local 5G network construction. The United States also instigated pressure on Canada to unreasonably detain Huawei's chief financial officer for nearly three years.
- The United States has violated the principles of fair competition, market economy and international economic and trade rules, and has pursued and intercepted Chinese high-tech companies with international competitiveness under various trumped-up names. So far, more than 1,000 Chinese companies have been included in various sanctions lists; Technology, artificial intelligence and other key control technologies, strengthen export control, strict investment review; suppress Chinese social media applications including TikTok and WeChat.
- Under the guise of "protecting human rights", the US fabricated lies and rumors about "forced labor" and other Xinjiang-related lies, and on this basis introduced the so-called "Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act" to maliciously suppress Xinjiang's cotton, tomato, solar photovoltaic and other advantageous industries, curb China's development disrupts the international trade order and undermines the stability of the global industrial chain and supply chain.
- The previous administration of the United States seriously violated WTO rules and launched a large-scale trade war against China. According to the so-called "Section 301 Investigation", the United States has imposed high tariffs on about US$360 billion of Chinese goods exported to the United States in three rounds. In September 2021, at a time when global commodities were fluctuating at a high level, the current U.S. government announced the opening of a "232 investigation" on whether NdFeB permanent magnet materials harm U.S. national security.
- The United States has been grossly interfering in China's internal affairs on issues concerning China's core interests such as Taiwan, Xinjiang, Tibet, and Hong Kong for a long time.
- The "Bipartisan Innovation Act" under consideration by the U.S. Congress is under the banner of enhancing U.S. competitiveness. In fact, China is used as an "imaginary enemy" throughout the text. "China" is mentioned more than 800 times in the text. Content Terms.
- In order to maintain its international institutional power and monopoly position, the United States has smeared, smeared, blocked and blocked ideas and initiatives such as building a community with a shared future for mankind and jointly building the "Belt and Road" in multilateral institutions, and prevented relevant ideas and initiatives from being included in the United Nations and other international organizations document.
- The United States upholds the Cold War mentality, follows the logic of hegemony, promotes bloc politics, concocts a narrative of "democracy against authoritarianism", attracts other countries to piece together a "small circle", strengthens the "Five Eyes Alliance", sells the "quadlateral mechanism", and piece together the trilateral security of the United States, Britain and Australia Partnerships, tightening of bilateral military alliances, and clear attempts to target China.
- The United States pushes NATO to intervene in Asia-Pacific affairs, throws out a new version of the "Strategic Concept" document to hype the "China threat", and invites Japan, South Korea, Australia and other Asia-Pacific allies to participate in the NATO Madrid Summit in an attempt to establish an "Asia-Pacific version of NATO", which seriously threatens the security and stability of the Asia-Pacific region .
- The development of relations between countries should focus on equality, respect and mutual benefit. At present, China-US relations are at an important crossroads. The US side should give up viewing China-US relations with a Cold War zero-sum mentality, and focus on practicing the "three principles" of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation, and put the "four "No one or no intention" (not seeking to start a new Cold War with China, not seeking to change China's system, not seeking to oppose China by strengthening alliance relations, not supporting "Taiwan independence" and not intending to conflict with China) has been implemented.

### Fallacy 3: US diplomacy is based on partnership and respect for each other's interests, while China's coercive diplomacy against other countries and wanton retaliation. Our task is to demonstrate that all nations are free to chart their own path without coercion.
### FACT: The United States is the inventor and master of coercive diplomacy. Over the years, the United States has demonstrated to the world textbook cases of coercive diplomacy through economic blockade and unilateral sanctions.

- In 1971, American scholar Alexander George first proposed the concept of "coercive diplomacy", which was used to summarize the policies of the United States towards Laos, Cuba and Vietnam at that time. The U.S. government called the 1994 forced downfall of the Haitian military government "an example of coercive diplomacy."
	- The US government, on the grounds of punishing the Afghan Taliban, froze the US$7 billion assets of the Central Bank of Afghanistan in the US, and took the "life-saving money" of the Afghan people as its own, resulting in the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Afghanistan. Mohammad Naeem, spokesman for the political office of the Afghan Taliban in Doha, said the U.S. actions showed that it "has been degraded to the lowest level in terms of humanity and morality."
	- In order to force the Nepalese parliament to approve the Nimei "Millennium Challenge Plan (MCC)" agreement, the United States openly issued an "ultimatum", saying that if the Nepalese parliament did not pass the relevant agreement on time, it would re-examine the diplomatic relations between Nepal and the United States.
	- After the Russian-Ukrainian conflict broke out, the U.S. Department of Justice set up a “special team for the arrest of thieves” to search for Russian citizens’ yachts, apartments, private jets and huge deposits in the United States and Europe, freezing and confiscating them. The sanctity of property" is just a lie. The United States has forced countries to choose sides and put pressure on countries to join sanctions against Russia, otherwise it will "pay the price".
	- Since China and the Solomon Islands signed a bilateral security cooperation framework agreement, the US has arranged for senior officials of the National Security Council to visit the institute, striving to obstruct the legitimate cooperation between China and Solomon Islands. The "Solomon Star" commented that the United States has completely forgotten the Solomon Islands since World War II, and now it finally remembers it, but it wants to force the Solomon Islands to give up signing the agreement with China.
	- In May 2022, on the eve of a high-level video conference of the Group of Friends of the Global Development Initiative, the United States put pressure on a number of United Nations development agencies to block participation and threaten to "cut funding."
- The "Clean Network" program launched by the previous US administration brought coercive diplomacy to the fore. Under the pretext of maintaining U.S. national security and citizens' privacy, the plan clearly requires that Chinese companies such as Huawei, Baidu, and Alibaba be completely eliminated from five aspects: telecom operators, mobile application stores, mobile applications, cloud services, and submarine optical cables. The then US Secretary of State Pompeo and other US politicians lobbied and coerced other countries and regions to join the so-called "Clean Network Coalition". Senior U.S. officials have even intimidated countries such as Cyprus, demanding that these countries not be allowed to cooperate with Chinese 5G suppliers, otherwise the consequences will be severe. Former British business secretary John Cable said that the British government's decision to ban Huawei's 5G equipment and services "has nothing to do with national security", but was pressured by the United States because "the United States told us we should do it."
- The United States is not relentless in coercing its allies. Due to geopolitical and energy interests, the United States has imposed sanctions on the "North Stream-2" natural gas pipeline project since December 2019. After the Russian-Ukrainian conflict broke out, the United States imposed new sanctions on related companies and personnel even though Germany had announced the suspension of the certification process for the project.
- American scholars point out that since World War II, U.S. foreign policy has been based on a simple concept - "You are either with us or against us. The United States should lead, the allies should follow, and against the United States The nation of supremacy will suffer." This fully exposed the nature of US coercive diplomacy.
- China never engages in coercive diplomacy, and is firmly opposed to other countries engaging in coercive diplomacy. China does not use force to threaten other countries, does not cobble together military alliances, does not export ideology, does not go to the door of others to provoke trouble, does not reach into others' homes, does not take the initiative to provoke trade wars, and does not unreasonably suppress other countries' companies. However, China has the right to make necessary and legitimate responses to actions that undermine China's sovereignty, security and development rights and interests.

### Fallacy 4: The American model of democracy is one of America's most powerful capitals in competition with China. Our mission is to demonstrate that democracy can meet pressing challenges and that the future belongs to those who believe in freedom.
### Facts: The United States defines "democratic standards" according to its own model, and does not allow other systems and models to exist. It forms factions and arbitrarily interferes in other countries' internal affairs under the banner of so-called "democracy". This is not the meaning of democracy, but It's a disaster for democracy.

- American democracy is a "rich man's game" based on capital. Money politics runs through all aspects of elections, legislation, and governance in the United States, which actually limits the people's right to participate in politics. The inequality of economic status has been transformed into the inequity of political status. equality. According to statistics, 91% of U.S. congressional elections are won by the candidates with the most financial support, while big companies, a few rich people and interest groups have made more lavish efforts, becoming the main source of election funds. After these so-called "public opinion representatives" are successfully elected, they often serve the financial masters behind them and become spokespersons for vested interests, rather than speaking for ordinary people. A US senator pointedly pointed out: "Some people think that the US Congress controls Wall Street, but the truth is that Wall Street controls the US Congress."
	- Congressman Mo Brooks, a Republican from Alabama, publicly refuted the "corruption system of the US Congress" in a social media video, saying that if US congressmen want to get seats on major congressional committees, they must buy them, and the cost depends on the importance of the committees Sex, top commissioner seats start at $1 million. "If Congressmen can't pay that, they have to accept donations from special interest groups and then thank those political lobbyists after they take office, special interest groups run Washington, and I'm not making an analogy, I'm serious," said Boo. ."
- Singaporean academics say it is clear that the US is a plutocratic country, not a democracy. Democracy represents a government owned by the people, governed by the people, and enjoyed by the people, while plutocratic rule means that the government is owned, governed by, and enjoyed by the rich one percent.
- The U.S. presidential election follows the Electoral College system, where the President and Vice-President are voted by the Electoral College. The drawbacks of this electoral system are very obvious: firstly, the elected president may not be able to win the majority of popular votes and is under-represented; secondly, the specific election rules are determined by the states themselves, which is prone to chaos; thirdly, the "winner takes all" system aggravates states, The unequal status of each party causes huge waste of votes and suppresses turnout. Voters in deep blue states and deep red states are often ignored. Swing states gain relatively asymmetric importance and become the target of competition between the two parties. There have been 5 times in U.S. history where the country has won the national popular vote but lost a presidential election.
	- "Jerry's Salamander" is a major drawback of the electoral system recognized by the American public, that is, it refers to helping the party win as many seats as possible and consolidate its dominant position through unfair constituency division. The United States conducts a census every 10 years, and then re-divides constituencies according to the principle of "the population of each constituency is roughly equal" and combined with population changes. The U.S. Constitution empowers state legislatures to divide constituencies, providing room for the "Jerry Salamander" majority party in the state legislature. The 2021 YouGov public opinion survey online poll shows that only 16% of voters believe that the state can divide constituencies fairly, 44% think it can't, and the remaining 40% are unsure.
- American-style democracy is called "one person, one vote", but it is actually "the rule of a few elites". "Pluralistic politics" is only a superficial phenomenon. Elites hold political, economic, and military dominance, control state machinery, formulate rules and regulations, grasp the direction of public opinion, dominate commercial companies, and exercise various privileges.
	- According to the Associated Press, the 2020 census results in the United States missed 18.8 million people, including 3.3% of the black population, about 5% of Hispanics, and 5.6% of Indians. This omission will lead to racial minorities in the acquisition of Education, health care, housing and other resources, as well as constituency divisions, are clearly disadvantaged, reflecting the hypocrisy of American democracy and its "systemic racism."
	- Noam Chomsky, a political critic and social activist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, pointed out that the United States is a "real capitalist democracy", and the influence of Americans on policymaking is positively correlated with their wealth level Relevance, about 70% of Americans have no influence on policy making, they are disadvantaged in terms of income level, wealth, etc., which is equivalent to being deprived of the right to participate in politics.
	- Wertheimer, chairman of the American non-profit organization "21st Century Democracy", once bluntly stated that corruption in the United States is the systemic corruption of the political process itself. When you handle billions of dollars, most of which are used to buy influence, The system is destroyed, and it is harder to maintain the representation of ordinary Americans.
	- American independent journalist Danny Haiphong believes that Western-style democracy regards the election itself as the highest achievement, and the question of whether the system serves the needs of the general public is often ignored and completely used to cover up the fact that strong of Western interest groups set the policy agenda before the vote.
- American-style democratic checks and balances become "veto politics". American political scientist Francis Fukuyama pointed out in his monograph "Political Order and Political Decline" that there is a deep-rooted political paralysis in the United States. There are too many checks and balances in the American political system, so that the cost of collective action has greatly increased, and sometimes it is even impossible to move a single step. . The American democratic process is scattered and lengthy, and there are a large number of veto points. Individual vetoes can affect the actions of the system. The so-called "mutual checks and balances imply the ability to correct deviations" are increasingly out of shape in practice. Politicians in Washington are focused on preserving partisan interests, and grand plans for national development have long been forgotten. The two parties in the United States are obsessed with "veto" and fall into a vicious circle that cannot be extricated. The result is bound to be weakened government effectiveness, trampled justice and rule of law, delayed development and progress, and magnified social divisions.
	- According to the survey results of 17 developed economies including the United States, Germany, and South Korea conducted by the American think tank Pew Research Center in October 2021, the United States is regarded as the most politically polarized country, and 90% of American respondents believe that different Partisan supporters are deeply divided, with nearly 60 percent of U.S. respondents believing that people disagree not only on policy but also on basic facts.
	- With the increasingly polarized partisan and political disputes, the Republicans and Democrats are more "opposition for the sake of opposition". Affected by this, the attitudes of voters in the two parties are also increasingly opposed. 76% of voters in the Republican Party defend the right to own guns, and 81% of voters in the Democratic Party believe that gun control is more important. Under the coercion of interests, party disputes, and public opinion, the process of legislation and law enforcement on gun control in the United States is struggling. Over the past 10 years, Democratic congressmen have put forward dozens of bills on gun violence and gun control every year, but due to the stubborn resistance of the Republican Party, only a handful of them have successfully entered the Senate or House of Representatives for deliberation and debate.
	- The National Rifle Association (NRA) has 5 million members and spends hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising and lobbying every year. Its tentacles penetrate deep into the fabric of American society. The NRA is an important funder of the Republican Party in the United States. Since its establishment in 1871, it has successfully attracted 9 presidents to join the membership. According to a 2018 CNN report, 307 of the 535 members of Congress have received political contributions from the association and its affiliates or benefited from its advertising. In the face of huge interests, all gun control efforts can only be in vain.
- The United States is not a top student of democracy, and the practice of democracy in the United States is full of chaos. Thousands of Americans gather on Capitol Hill in Washington and force their way into the Capitol on January 6, 2021, to prevent a joint session of the U.S. Congress from confirming the newly elected president of the United States. The incident led to the interruption of the transition process of the US presidential power and caused 5 deaths and more than 140 injuries. The incident, the worst violence in Washington since the White House was set on fire by British troops in 1814, shocked the international community. Republican leaders in the U.S. Senate called the incident a "failed rebellion."
	- Scholars of the Council on Foreign Relations of the United States said that the United States is not as different as many Americans think, and the incident of rushing into Congress should put an end to the sayings of "American exceptionalism" and "city on a hill".
	- American international affairs experts published an article in the "New York Times" saying that although the American leader has reunited the West, he may not be able to reunite the United States. Trump and his supporters deny the established constitutional rules and norms of the United States through lies, which may undermine the ability of the US government to transfer power peacefully and legally.
- The failure of the American-style democratic system has caused a crisis of confidence. The American-style democratic stage shouting at the people in front of the stage and making deals behind the scenes, the politics of the parties, the politics of money, and the politics of veto cannot bring about the high-quality governance that the people hope for. The American people are becoming more and more disgusted with American politics and more negative about American-style democracy.
	- In October 2020, a Gallup poll showed that only 19% of American respondents were very confident in the presidential election, the lowest level since 2004. According to a June 2022 poll by The Wall Street Journal, 60% of the public are pessimistic about the prospect of the "American Dream".
	- According to the 2021 Pew poll, 65% of Americans believe that the American democratic system needs major reforms; 16 developed countries have lower confidence in American democracy, and 57% of the respondents believe that the United States is no longer a model of democracy.
	- The 2021 "Democracy Perception Index" released by the German pollster shows that 44% of respondents in 53 countries believe that the United States threatens their democracy.
- For a long time, the United States has ignored the structural defects of its own democratic system and the inadequacy of its domestic democratic practice, and advocated the so-called "League of Democracies" and hyped the so-called "democracy against authoritarianism" narrative. As a tool to suppress other countries and promote geostrategy, it is fake democracy and real hegemony. Former senior CIA officials have publicly declared that it is in our national security interests to interfere. If you don't like it, bear with it.
	- In the name of "promoting democracy", the United States promoted the "New Monroe Doctrine" in Latin America, incited "color revolutions" in Eurasia, and remotely controlled the "Arab Spring" in West Asian and North African countries, bringing chaos and disaster to many countries. damage to world peace, stability and development. French online media pointed out that "democracy" has long been a "weapon of mass destruction" against dissident countries in the hands of the United States.
- Whether a country is democratic or not, the key lies in whether the people are the masters of the country. It depends on whether the people have the right to vote, but also whether the people have the right to participate widely; it depends on what verbal promises the people got in the election process. It depends on how many of these promises have been fulfilled after the election; it depends on what kind of political procedures and political rules are stipulated by the system and the law, and it depends on whether these systems and laws are actually implemented; it depends on whether the rules and procedures for the operation of power are democratic , but also depends on whether the power is really supervised and restricted by the people.
- The Communist Party of China leads the people to realize the people's democracy in the whole process. The whole process of people's democracy not only has a complete system and procedures, but also has a complete participatory practice. , orderly democratic channels. All the people practice democratic elections, democratic consultations, democratic decision-making, democratic management, and democratic supervision in accordance with the law, and manage state affairs, economic and cultural undertakings, and social affairs through various channels and forms in accordance with the law. China's whole-process people's democracy has realized the unity of process democracy and outcome democracy, procedural democracy and substantive democracy, direct democracy and indirect democracy, people's democracy and the will of the state. The real, most functional socialist democracy. China's whole-process people's democracy is increasingly recognized and praised by the international community.
	- British scholars bluntly stated that electoral democracy will not allow the people to establish a close relationship with the government, because it requires the participation of the people only when elections are held. The approach of Chinese-style democracy is very different, and consultation is a very important part of Chinese-style democracy.
- Democracy is historical, concrete, and developing. Democracy in each country is rooted in the historical and cultural traditions of its own country, and it grows from the practical exploration and wisdom creation of its own people. The path to democracy is different and the form of democracy is different. China insists on respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, not interfering in other countries' internal affairs, and respecting the development paths and social systems independently chosen by the people of all countries. China has no intention of engaging in institutional competition and ideological confrontation with the US. China never exports ideology, never interferes in other countries' internal affairs, and never seeks to change the US system.

### Fallacy 5: The United States has deep differences with the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese government, but those differences are between the government and the system, not the two peoples.
### Facts: The leadership of the Chinese Communist Party is the choice of history and the people. The Communist Party of China and the Chinese government have the wholehearted support and support of the Chinese people. The US sowing discord between the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people just proves its hostility to China's institutional path.

- The Communist Party of China is deeply rooted in the Chinese people, and is deeply connected with the Chinese people. It has always maintained strong vitality and vitality. By the end of 2021, the Communist Party of China has more than 95 million members and is the largest party in the world that has been in power for a long time in the world's most populous country. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, China has created the "two miracles" of rapid economic development and long-term social stability. More than 800 million people have been lifted out of poverty, and 1.4 billion people have moved toward modernization. In just a few decades, China has completed the number of developed countries in the West. The road of a hundred years.
	- Harvard University has tracked polls for 13 consecutive years, showing that the Chinese people's support rate for the party and the government has remained above 90% for a long time, ranking first in the world for consecutive years. Edelman, a well-known American public relations company, released a trust survey report in 2022, showing that the Chinese people’s trust in their own government reached 91% in the past year, ranking first among the countries surveyed.
- The previous administration of the United States engaged in McCarthyism, vigorously attacked and smeared the Chinese Communist Party, attacked Chinese leaders and domestic and foreign policies, sow discord between the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, blatantly challenged the leadership and ruling status of the Chinese Communist Party, incited anti-China hatred of the Communist Party, and advocated targeting Chinese Communist Party members and their family members to take visa restrictions.
	- Since the current US administration took office, no substantial changes have been made to the above policies. In June 2021, the U.S. Senate reviewed and passed the more than 2,000-page "American Innovation and Competition Act of 2021", which regards China as the United States' strategic competitor and the most important challenge, slanders China's development path and domestic and foreign policies, and makes false remarks. To resist the "influence and malicious actions" of the Chinese Communist Party, it is required to allocate more than 200 billion US dollars to ensure the US's advantage over China in key technological fields, and advocates mobilizing the US strategic, diplomatic, economic, technological and other means to carry out comprehensive strategic competition with China. The U.S. Senate also proposed to allocate $300 million per year from fiscal years 2022 to 2026 to “respond to the CCP’s malicious influence,” and to assign the U.S. State Department and the Agency for International Development to develop the investigative capabilities of U.S. journalists on the “Belt and Road” initiative, including “supporting the CCP’s malicious influence.” Civic Organizations and Independent Media” etc.
	- The US continues to suppress the normal people-to-people and cultural exchanges and cooperation between the two countries under the pretext of having a Chinese Communist Party background. For a period of time, there have been frequent incidents of unreasonable harassment and suppression of Chinese students studying in the United States and visiting students.

### Fallacy 6: The United States calls on China to change in terms of human rights, not to oppose China, but to maintain peace, security and human dignity.
### Facts: The human rights of the Chinese people have been unprecedentedly guaranteed, and the people's sense of gain, happiness and security has never been greater. On the contrary, the U.S. has widespread and serious violations of human rights at home and abroad, and what it has done is appalling. The United States is the world's largest human rights violator.

- China has always put the protection of the right to subsistence in the first place, the promotion of the right to development has always been a priority, the protection of the legitimate rights and interests of citizens has always been a basic task, the protection of the rights of ethnic minorities has always been an important content, and the protection of people's safety has always been a long-term goal.
	- The Communist Party of China adheres to the people-centered approach. From the day it was born, it has taken the pursuit of happiness for the Chinese people and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation as its original mission, and has been fighting for the interests of the people for more than 100 years. People's yearning for a better life is our goal. China continues to develop people's democracy in the whole process, promotes the protection of human rights and the rule of law, and maintains social fairness and justice. The Chinese people enjoy broader, fuller and more comprehensive democratic rights.
- China has created a miracle of eradicating absolute poverty. By the end of 2020, all 98.99 million rural poor people under China's current standards will be lifted out of poverty. By 2021, China will build a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way, and historically solve the problem of absolute poverty. Since the reform and opening up, according to the current poverty standards, China's 770 million rural poor people have been lifted out of poverty; according to the World Bank's international poverty standards, China's poverty reduction population accounted for more than 70% of the global poverty reduction population during the same period. China achieved the poverty reduction goal of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 10 years ahead of schedule, and made significant contributions to the development of global poverty reduction and the progress of human rights in the world. China has also built the world's largest education system, social security system and health care system.
- Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pneumonia, China has adhered to the principle of putting people first and life first, formulating and implementing the general policy of "dynamic clearing" based on its own national conditions, and constantly adjusts prevention and control measures according to the circumstances to maximize the protection of people's lives and health, and at the same time Ensure the sustainable, healthy and stable development of the economy and society with good prevention and control effects. China's new crown infection rate and death rate are among the lowest in the world.
- China has actively participated in global human rights governance, made Chinese contributions to the development of the world human rights cause, and provided Chinese solutions. In recent years, the UN Human Rights Council resolutions have been written into "Building a Community with a Shared Future for Mankind". The UN Human Rights Council has repeatedly adopted China's resolutions such as "Development's contribution to the enjoyment of all human rights" and "Promoting win-win cooperation in the field of human rights". The second representative of developing countries made a joint speech on "implementing the right to development", "reducing poverty and promoting human rights", and "promoting the fair distribution of global vaccines", contributing to safeguarding the basic human rights of developing countries and winning wide approval and support from the international community.
- China is an advocate for promoting the development of the international human rights cause, and it is also an activist. A research report released by the World Bank shows that the full implementation of the “Belt and Road” initiative can lift 32 million people out of moderate poverty with an average daily living cost of less than US$3.2, indicating that the joint construction of the “Belt and Road” will effectively enhance the protection of human rights in more countries. Level. In the face of the new crown epidemic, China has implemented the largest global humanitarian action since the founding of the People's Republic of China, and actively promoted the joint construction of a community of human health. Faced with the global development deficit, China has put forward a global development initiative, which takes improving people's well-being and realizing all-round development as the starting point and goal. It has received support from more than 100 countries and many international organizations such as the United Nations. The initiative has gathered broad international consensus for promoting countries to accelerate the implementation of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which will help strengthen the international synergy for coordinated development and provide a strong guarantee for the development of the international human rights cause.
- The right to life is the greatest human right, and survival is the basis for the enjoyment of all human rights. The United States has the most advanced medical equipment and technology in the world, but it has become the country with the highest number of new coronary pneumonia infections and deaths in the world. Epidemic prevention and control has always been highly politicized, and it has become a tool and bargaining chip for Republicans and Democrats to criticize, veto, and confront each other. Politicians only focus on political self-interest, but ignore the lives and health of the people. Unscientific, unequal, and irresponsible epidemic prevention and control has seriously damaged the American people's right to life and health.
	- At present, the number of deaths from the new crown in the United States has exceeded 1 million, and the American "Atlantic Monthly" commented, "unexpected", "unpredictable", "particularly distressing" and "avoidable in many cases". American politicians also claimed that "the elderly can sacrifice for the country" and "the national economy is more important than the lives of the elderly". According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, most of the patients who died from the new coronary pneumonia epidemic were over the age of 65. Covid-19 has cut the average American's life expectancy by 1.13 years, the largest drop since World War II, according to research from the University of Southern California and Princeton University. Among them, the average life expectancy of African Americans and Hispanics fell by 2.1 years and 3.05 years, while the average life expectancy of whites fell by 0.68 years.
	- The US "Washington Post" reported that behind the 1 million American deaths from new coronary pneumonia, there is a higher number - 9 million. This is the number of Americans who have lost spouses, parents, grandparents, siblings and children to COVID-19. Monitoring by Imperial College London shows that as of May 23, 2022, more than 250,000 children in the United States have lost a primary or secondary guardian due to the new crown epidemic. According to data released by the U.S. Government Accountability Office in March 2022, 23 million people in the United States may suffer from long-term symptoms of the new crown, and it is estimated that about 1 million people cannot work due to the effects of sequelae.
- The United States is the country with the worst gun violence. The United States has a population of 333 million, accounting for only 4% of the global population, but has more than 400 million guns, accounting for 46% of the total number of private firearms in the world. The civilian gun ownership rate ranks first in the world. More than 110 lives. Many people feel that it is easier to buy a gun in the United States than to buy milk powder.
	- According to data from the US "Gun Violence Archives" website, about 45,000 Americans will die from gun violence in 2021. On May 24, 2022, a shooting at Rob Elementary School in Texas, USA, killed 21 people, including 19 children. According to US media statistics, this is the 39th school shooting in the United States this year. According to the Washington Post, there have been 202 mass shootings in the United States in the five and a half months of this year. Over the past few decades, the US government has not seen any substantial steps to address these issues. For the past 25 years, the federal government has failed to introduce a gun control bill. "The New York Times" commented that the United States has become ungovernable not because of political differences or protests or uncivilization, but because of this country's unwillingness to protect and care for its citizens - its women, its minorities, and especially its children.
- America's Founding Fathers said "all men are created equal" while retaining slavery in the 1789 Constitution. Today, although the United States has apparently abolished the racial segregation system, white supremacy is rampant, and discrimination against ethnic minorities still exists systematically. The deep-rooted racism "virus" in the United States is spreading with the new crown virus, anti-Asian hate crimes are frequent and high, racial persecution of indigenous people continues, discrimination against Muslim groups continues unabated, the racial economic divide continues to widen, racial Inequality is growing. It's been nearly 60 years since Martin Luther King Jr. shouted "I have a dream", but people still see the harsh reality of Floyd's "I can't breathe".
- The United States carried out genocide against Indians by means of massacre, expulsion, sterilization, forced assimilation, etc., which caused the Indian population to plummet from 5 million in 1492 to 250,000 in the early 20th century. Native American groups have been neglected and discriminated against for a long time, the culture of Indians has been fundamentally destroyed, and the intergenerational survival of life and spirit has been seriously threatened. Many U.S. government statistics ignore Indians entirely, or sloppily classify them as "other."
	- Shannon Keller, executive director and attorney for the American Indian Affairs Association, said, "We are culturally and linguistically diverse, yet often seen not as an ethnic group, but only as a political class, based on our The American "Atlantic Monthly" commented that from the historical expulsion, slaughter and forced assimilation, to today's overall poverty and neglect, the Indians who were originally the masters of this continent have The voice in American society is weak.
	- In order to promote English and Christian education, the U.S. government has historically implemented a boarding school system for Indians, and has also enacted laws to prohibit indigenous people from holding religious ceremonies that are passed down from generation to generation. On October 11, 2021, the U.S. "Foreign Policy" website published an article titled "The United States Must Face Up to Its Genocide", stating that more than 350 indigenous boarding schools funded and established by the U.S. government between the 19th and 20th centuries forced indigenous Resident children are separated from their families and communities and enrolled in remote boarding schools, where they are culturally assimilated. Hundreds of thousands of Aboriginal children were forcibly displaced from their homes, and many died in school after being abused. In these boarding schools, the identities, languages, and beliefs of American Indian, Alaska, and Native Hawaiians were suppressed. The United States committed genocide not only morally, but legally against its own people.
	- American Indian author Rebecca Nagel argues that information about Native Americans is being systematically purged from mainstream American media and popular culture. According to a report by the Native American Education Organization, 87 percent of state-level history textbooks do not address Indigenous history after 1900. The Smithsonian Institution and others have written that the content of Indians taught in American schools is full of inaccurate information and does not truthfully describe the experience of indigenous peoples. Former Republican Senator Santorum actually publicly stated at the American Youth Foundation that "America is a country born from zero. Before that, there was almost nothing here... To be honest, there is almost no Native American culture in American culture."
- Fear, discrimination, and suppression of Muslims and Islam in mainstream American society have intensified. Bloomberg reported on September 9, 2021 that in the 20 years after the "9.11" incident, discrimination against Muslims in the United States has been on the rise. The Associated Press reported on September 9, 2021 that 53 percent of Americans have a negative view of Islam, the survey found. A 2021 report from the Council on American-Islamic Relations said the group receives more complaints each year about bullying and Muslim-hate speech.
	- According to the survey data released by the Institute of Otherness and Belonging of the University of California, Berkeley on October 29, 2021, 67.5% of Muslim respondents have experienced the harm caused by "Islamophobia", and 93.7% of Muslim respondents said their physical and mental health was negatively affected by "Islamophobia".
- The United States is a hardest hit area for human trafficking and forced labor, and has yet to ratify the 1930 Convention on Forced Labor, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. With a population of nearly 100,000, at least 500,000 people are currently enslaved in the United States, and 240,000 to 325,000 women and children are sexually enslaved.
- The immigrant and refugee issue has become a political tool for partisan criticism and political struggles in the United States. The government has changed decrees, violent law enforcement, and immigrant groups have been subjected to inhumane treatment such as extended detention, torture and forced labor. Data released by the U.S. Border Enforcement agency showed that as many as 557 migrants died on the U.S. southern border in fiscal 2021, more than double the previous fiscal year and the highest number since records began in 1998. That same year, the U.S. detained more than 1.7 million immigrants, including 45,000 children, along the southern border. In September 2021, more than 15,000 asylum seekers from Haiti gathered under a bridge in the border town of Del Rio, Texas, to sleep in filthy tents or mud on sweltering heat, surrounded by rubbish, The living environment is very bad. U.S. Border Enforcement brutalized the asylum-seekers, with patrols on horseback and whip-lashing at the crowds, driving them into the river. CNN commented that this scene is reminiscent of the dark era in American history when slave patrols were used to control black slaves.
- The U.S. government is indifferent to the systematic violation of the human rights of the American people, but under the guise of human rights, it recklessly attacks and interferes with other countries, challenges justice with power, and tramples justice with selfish interests.
	- Since 2001, the United States has waged wars or conducted military operations in the name of "anti-terrorism" in about 80 countries, killing more than 900,000 people, including 300,000 civilians. The 20-year war in Afghanistan launched by the United States has left Afghanistan devastated and people's livelihood withered. According to statistics, a total of 47,245 Afghan civilians and 66,000 to 69,000 Afghan soldiers and policemen unrelated to the "9.11" incident were killed in the US military operations, and more than 10 million people were displaced. The war in Afghanistan destroyed the foundation of Afghanistan's economic development and left the Afghan people impoverished. After the United States withdrew from Afghanistan, it immediately froze billions of dollars of foreign exchange reserves of the Central Bank of Afghanistan, which brought the Afghan economy to the brink of collapse and made people's lives even worse.
	- At the 48th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council, many countries condemned the United States as "the biggest destroyer of the cause of human rights in the world" and urged the United States to solve its own serious human rights problems.
- The United States is a veteran of arbitrary detention and indiscriminate torture. Over the years, the CIA has set up "black prisons" in at least 54 countries and regions under the guise of the so-called "war on terror", detaining up to 100,000 people. On January 10, 2022, the independent panel of experts on human rights appointed by the United Nations Human Rights Council issued a statement stating that for 20 years, the United States has arbitrarily detained people in Guantanamo Prison without trial, and subjected them to torture or ill-treatment, in violation of international human rights law, It's "a stain on the U.S. government's commitment to the rule of law." The United States should face up to and correct its own systemic and long-term human rights problems, reflect on the humanitarian disasters and crimes it has caused around the world, and give the world a responsible account.

### Fallacy 7: The US still pursues the one-China policy based on the "Taiwan Relations Act", the three US-China Joint Communiqués, and the "Six Assurances to Taiwan". The US policy towards Taiwan has not changed.
### Facts: The one-China principle is a universally recognized norm of international relations and a general consensus of the international community. The United States has betrayed its promises, continuously backsliding from its own commitments and the consensus between China and the United States, virtualizing and hollowing out the one-China principle, and attempting to "use Taiwan to control China", which is one of the main threats to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.

- In October 1971, the United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly passed Resolution 2758, which decided to restore the legitimate seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, which has completely resolved the issue of China's representation in the United Nations politically, legally and procedurally. The official legal opinion of the Office of Legal Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat clearly states that "Taiwan, as a province of China, has no independent status" and that "the Taiwan authorities do not enjoy any form of government status", and the title used should be "Taiwan, a province of China (Taiwan, Province of China)”.
	- On the basis of the one-China principle, China has established diplomatic relations with 181 countries including the United States.
- The US made commitments to China on the one-China principle in the three Sino-US joint communiques.
	- The U.S. side clearly stated in the "Shanghai Communiqué" published in 1972: "The U.S. recognizes that all Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Strait believe that there is only one China and that Taiwan is a part of China. The U.S. government has no objection to this position. ."
	- The United States clearly stated in the "Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations" published in 1978: "The United States of America recognizes that the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government of China. The government of the United States of America recognizes China's position that there is only one China and Taiwan is a part of China. "
	- The United States clearly stated in the "August 17" Communiqué issued in 1982: "In the Joint Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations issued by the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the United States of America on January 1, 1979, the United States of America recognized The government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government of China and recognizes China's position that there is only one China and Taiwan is a part of China. The U.S. government has no intention of infringing upon China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, nor interfering in China's internal affairs, or enforcing the 'two One China' or 'One China, One Taiwan' policy."
	- "The U.S. government declares that it does not seek to implement a long-term policy of arms sales to Taiwan, that the weapons it sells to Taiwan will not exceed the level of supply in recent years after the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States in terms of performance and quantity, and it is prepared to gradually reduce Its arms sales to Taiwan led to a final settlement over time. In making such a statement, the United States acknowledges China's consistent position on a complete resolution of this issue."
- The U.S. side did not earnestly abide by its commitments on the Taiwan issue, but continued to reverse the course of history.
	- Politically, the United States has successively inserted the so-called "Taiwan Relations Act" and "Six Assurances to Taiwan" into one China policy statement, and the prefixes of the US policy statement are increasing. These two prefixes were unilaterally fabricated by the US side, which violated its own commitments in the three Sino-US joint communiqués, and also violated the one-China principle recognized by the UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 and generally abided by the international community. It is illegal and invalid from the beginning, and China has not recognized it and firmly opposed it from the very beginning. The United States has also violated its commitment to maintain only unofficial relations with Taiwan, and has continuously improved the level of US-Taiwan engagement. In recent years, senior officials such as the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Deputy Secretary of State, and members of Congress have visited Taiwan one after another. The US ambassador abroad has also met with the so-called "representatives" of Taiwan in the local area on many occasions.
	- Militarily, the United States has violated its commitment to gradually reduce arms sales to Taiwan and lead to a final resolution after a period of time. Offensive weapons such as 16V fighter jets have so far totaled more than $70 billion in arms sales. Reuters and others also reported that members of the U.S. special operations forces have been temporarily rotating Taiwan to train Taiwan troops.
	- Since 2021, U.S. leaders have publicly stated three times that if there is a war in the Taiwan Strait, the U.S. will help defend Taiwan.
	- Internationally, the US continues to help Taiwan expand the so-called "international space". Recently, the United States has spread the fallacy that the UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 did not address Taiwan's status, claiming that all countries have the right to define a China policy framework by themselves. They have also strongly encouraged Taiwan to participate in the 75th World Health Assembly as an observer, and even jumped to the front desk to help Taiwan. "Solid State".
- What the U.S. has done has violated the U.S. commitment that it has no intention of implementing the "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" policy. Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said at the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2022, "The United States should not adopt a quibble or incremental approach to developing the 'two Chinas' solution. What I understand is that the agreement reached when China and the United States established diplomatic relations is that the United States will pursue The one-China principle. Upholding the one-China principle is crucial."
- The Taiwan Democratic Progressive Party authorities stubbornly promote the "Taiwan independence" separatist act, and the United States explicitly and secretly encourages and supports the "Taiwan independence" forces. This is the root cause of the current tension in the Taiwan Strait. To stop the development of "Taiwan independence" tendencies and to curb US-Taiwan collusion is to maintain peace across the Taiwan Strait and the world. The one-China principle cannot be shaken, China's sovereignty and territorial integrity cannot be violated, and the red line of "two Chinas" and "one China, one Taiwan" cannot be trampled on. China is fully confident, fully capable, and fully prepared to resolutely curb "Taiwan independence" separatist activities, resolutely thwart all external interference, and resolutely safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity. The U.S. side should abide by the three Sino-U.S. joint communiqués, pursue a genuine one-China policy, implement its commitments such as not supporting "Taiwan independence", and earnestly reflect on its own erroneous words and deeds that keep going backwards. It seriously endangers the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait, and seriously damages China-US relations. The US itself will also pay an unbearable price for this.

### Fallacy 8: The United States joins the nations and peoples of the world in opposing "genocide" and "crimes against humanity" in Xinjiang. More than 1 million people in Xinjiang have been detained in internment camps because of their ethnic minority status and religious beliefs.
### Facts: The human rights of people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang are fully guaranteed, and there is no such thing as "genocide" and "crimes against humanity". The U.S. has repeatedly spread lies about Xinjiang, which is entirely an excuse to smear and suppress China.

- Xinjiang-related issues are not human rights issues at all, but anti-violence, terrorism and anti-secession issues. According to incomplete statistics, from 1990 to the end of 2016, thousands of violent terrorist incidents (incidents) occurred in Xinjiang, resulting in the killing of a large number of innocent people, hundreds of public security and police officers, and incalculable property damage.
	- Facing the real threat of terrorism and extremism, Xinjiang has taken decisive measures to fight against terrorism and de-radicalization in accordance with the law. "Education and Training Center") to provide assistance and education and other methods, effectively curbing the trend of frequent terrorist activities. In Xinjiang, there have been no cases of violence and terrorism for more than five consecutive years. The society is safe and stable, the development continues to improve, and the safety of people of all ethnic groups has been effectively guaranteed.
- The "genocide" in Xinjiang is an outright "lie of the century". Over the past 60 years in China's Xinjiang region, the total Uyghur population has grown from 2.2 million to about 12 million, and the average life expectancy has increased from 30 to 75 years.
	- At present, the overall social situation in Xinjiang is stable, the people live and work in peace and contentment, and unprecedented achievements have been made in economic and social development and improvement of people's livelihood. From 2014 to 2019, Xinjiang's GDP increased from 919.59 billion yuan to 1,359.71 billion yuan, with an average annual growth rate of 7.2%. The per capita disposable income of Xinjiang residents increased by 9.1% annually. Decisive achievements have been made in poverty alleviation. All 3.089 million poor people under the current standard have been lifted out of poverty, and the problem of absolute poverty in Xinjiang has been solved historically.
	- The legitimate rights and interests of people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have been effectively protected. All ethnic groups, regardless of their population, have the same legal status, and enjoy freedom of religious belief and rights to participate in the management of state affairs according to law, receive education, use their own spoken and written languages, and inherit their own traditional culture.
- In July 2019, the permanent representatives of more than 50 countries in Geneva jointly sent a letter to the President of the UN Human Rights Council and the High Commissioner for Human Rights, positively commenting on China's achievements in counter-terrorism, de-radicalization and protection of human rights. In October 2019, more than 60 countries spoke on the sidelines of the Third Committee of the 74th UN General Assembly, praising China's huge human rights progress in Xinjiang. In June 2021, more than 90 countries will support China at the Human Rights Council through joint or separate speeches. At the same time, Canada took the lead in attacking China on issues related to Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and Tibet, and only more than 40 countries agreed, none of which was a Muslim country.
- In recent years, more than 2,000 experts, scholars, journalists, diplomats, religious figures and other people from more than 100 countries have visited Xinjiang and witnessed the unity, harmony and joy of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang.
- The so-called "genocide" in Xinjiang is a lie concocted by anti-China forces, represented by German anti-China scholar Zheng Guoen. Zheng Guoen is a member of the far-right organization "Communist Victims Memorial Foundation" established by the US government. He is also the backbone of an anti-China agency manipulated and established by the US intelligence agency. Zheng Guoen's "research" is full of loopholes, filled with a lot of fabricated facts and falsified data. He does not have any academic background and cannot pass any academic publication review. For example, its "paper" has a graph claiming that women in Xinjiang receive between 800 and 1,400 IUD implants per year. This means that each Xinjiang woman has to undergo 4 to 8 IUD placement operations per day, which is totally against common sense.
- The Jamestown Foundation of the United States released a so-called "research report" fabricated by Zheng Guoen on June 29, 2020, falsely claiming that the Chinese government is suspected of "genocide" against ethnic minorities in Xinjiang.
	- After the "report" was thrown out, American politicians including then US Secretary of State Pompeo, US State Department Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom Affairs Brownback, Senator Rubio, Representative McGovern, etc. quickly joined the hype , talking about the so-called "genocide" issue. Since then, Rubio, McGovern, U.S. Senators Cornyn, Menendez and others have asked the U.S. government to identify the Chinese government's Xinjiang policy as "genocide". Pompeo announced on January 19, 2021, the last day of the previous U.S. administration's term, that the Chinese government "has targeted the Uyghur ethnic group in Xinjiang," when lawyers from the U.S. State Department's Office of Legal Counsel believed the determination was untenable. and other ethnic and religious minorities committed crimes against humanity" and "committed genocide". After taking office, the current US administration has followed the position of the previous administration and continued to slander Xinjiang as "genocide", further exposing the true face of the US's political manipulation on the basis of human rights issues.
- The anti-China separatist organization "World Uyghur Council" manipulated "actors" such as Sayragul Sawutibayi and Tursunnayi Tsyaodeng to give false testimony and spread all kinds of lies about being "persecuted". The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has so far held more than 70 Xinjiang-related press conferences, exposing the lies spread by anti-China forces with facts. Among these hired "actors", some claim to have been forcibly sterilized in the education and training center, but have never studied in the education and training center; In fact, they live a normal life in society.
- The "China Human Rights Defenders Network", an NGO supported by the US government, was the first to propose and spread the fallacy of "Millions of Uyghurs detained in education and training centers". Based on interviews with eight Uyghurs and a rough estimate, the organization came to the absurd conclusion that "10% of the population of 20 million in Xinjiang are detained in 're-education camps'".
	- The education and training centers in Xinjiang are essentially the same as the de-radicalization centers, community corrections, transformation and disengagement programs implemented in many countries around the world. Practice has proved that this is a successful exploration of preventive counter-terrorism and de-radicalization, which fully conforms to the principles and spirit of a series of counter-terrorism resolutions such as the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and the United Nations Action Plan to Prevent Violent Extremism. The education and training center has improved the students' ability to use the common national language and employability, and enhanced the students' national awareness, civic awareness, and awareness of the rule of law. In October 2019, all students of the education and training center graduated. The graduates either choose their own jobs, or start their own businesses, or find employment with the help of the government, and most of them have achieved stable employment.
- The accusations and accusations made by the US and Western countries on the human rights issue in Xinjiang ignore the basic facts of human rights protection and development in Xinjiang, and are completely tools to achieve their strategic goal of "using Xinjiang to control China".
	- In August 2018, former US Secretary of State Powell's chief of staff, former Army Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson publicly stated that one of the three-fold purpose of the US military presence in Afghanistan is to contain China: "The CIA wants to destabilize China, it is best to The solution is to create unrest in China. To stimulate Beijing with those Uyghurs, without external force, directly bring down China from the inside.”

### Fallacy 9: The Chinese Communist Party uses national security as a cover to implement harsh, anti-democratic measures in Hong Kong. Beijing’s actions to suppress freedoms in Hong Kong violated China’s commitments in the Sino-British Joint Declaration.
### Facts: The essence of the US attack and smearing of the Hong Kong National Security Law is to interfere in Hong Kong affairs and use Hong Kong as a "bridgehead" for infiltration and interference in the mainland. Hong Kong is China's Hong Kong, and Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs, which allow no interference from the US.

- The United States has long colluded with Hong Kong's anti-China and chaotic forces in Hong Kong, intervening in Hong Kong's political agenda, constantly intensifying social conflicts, and even directly intervening in Hong Kong affairs. The U.S. Consul General in Hong Kong has publicly criticized the Hong Kong SAR government for the amendment and "one country, two systems". Officials from the U.S. consulate general in Hong Kong also met with the leaders of the chaos. Hong Kong rioters openly admitted that they talked with the United States about the legislative process of the "Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act" and urged the United States to stop exporting tear gas and rubber bullets to the Hong Kong police.
- The U.S. National Endowment for Democracy and other U.S. government "white gloves" funded and instigated anti-China rioters in Hong Kong to smash, smash, loot and burn in the name of fighting for so-called democracy and freedom. Hong Kong staged a "color revolution". The National Endowment for Democracy has contacted Hong Kong opposition political groups and organizations mainly through its affiliated American Association for Democracy in International Affairs. Workshops and seminars, providing individual consultations to the leaders of political groups, imparting electoral skills, launching the so-called "Young Political Leaders Program", cultivating new political groups to fight against the government, planning a "five-region referendum" with the opposition Legislative Council members, instructing , Funding Hong Kong opposition and radical youth cadres to plan illegal "Occupy Central" actions, etc.
	- According to the official website of the National Endowment for Democracy in the United States, in 2020, Hong Kong-related funds will be US$2 million, and there will be 11 projects, of which disrupting the Legislative Council election is an important task, and the focus includes the project of "strengthening citizens' monitoring of elections" to help the newly established Hong Kong Disruption Groups provide technical and financial assistance to encourage them to disrupt the Legislative Council elections by monitoring elections and competing for voting rights; the project "Expanding the Views of Citizens' Political Participation" collects and disseminates the results of public opinion surveys on democratic development, and induces Hong Kong youth to share through the Internet His political participation experience; the "Unity of Student Movement Supporters" project, before the Legislative Council election, to promote the interconnection of Hong Kong student groups, to guide and train their ability to promote "democratic change" and the ability to promote internationally, to participate in disruptive Election order; the project of "Building Regional Unity and Empowering Hong Kong Democracy Movement", strengthening Hong Kong "Democracy Movement" through the Internet, cultivating the next generation of Hong Kong "Activities Leaders", and laying out a network of "Democracy Movement" in Asia.
- U.S. officials called the incident of U.S. protesters on Capitol Hill a "violent incident" and "shame", but called the violent crime that harmed Hong Kong citizens and damaged public facilities a "beautiful landscape"; U.S. police dispatched armored vehicles to disperse the demonstrations The protesters abused force to beat and drive the sit-in demonstrators, deliberately induced the demonstrators to walk on the roadway and arrested them after the fact that they violated the law. However, they described the Hong Kong SAR government's legal protection of citizens' rights and social order as a "violation" of human rights. This once again shows what is called a hypocritical "American-style double standard", and once again exposes the United States' attempt to undermine Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and contain and suppress China in the name of "human rights" and "democracy".
- Looking back at the more than 150 years of British colonial rule, there is no democracy in Hong Kong. No Hong Kong Governor is democratically elected by the Hong Kong people. Most of the time, members of the legislature are directly appointed by the Governor. In sharp contrast, after the return of Hong Kong, according to the Basic Law, Hong Kong enjoys executive management, legislative, independent judicial and final adjudication powers. Unprecedented access to broad democratic rights and freedoms is a fact that anyone without prejudice will admit.
- The legislative purpose of the Hong Kong National Security Law is to close the legal loopholes in Hong Kong in safeguarding national security, and it is a legitimate and necessary move to deal with violent terrorist activities and illegal interference by external forces in Hong Kong. The constitutions of more than 100 countries in the world stipulate that the exercise of fundamental rights and freedoms must not endanger national security. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights stipulates that various rights such as freedom of belief, freedom of speech, freedom of peaceful assembly, and acceptance of public trials may be subject to necessary restrictions for reasons such as national security and public order. The European Convention on Human Rights has similar provisions.
	- The Hong Kong National Security Law only targets four types of crimes: the crime of secession, the crime of subversion of state power, the crime of terrorist activities, and the crime of colluding with foreign countries or foreign forces to endanger national security. It punishes a very small number of criminals who seriously endanger national security, and protects the The vast majority of Hong Kong citizens who abide by the law. Legislation is conducive to better safeguarding the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong residents in accordance with the law, better safeguarding the high degree of autonomy enjoyed by Hong Kong in accordance with the law, creating conditions for solving deep-seated problems such as the economy and people's livelihood, and maintaining Hong Kong's legal environment and business environment. To improve the business environment, eliminate business people's concerns about social chaos, and create better conditions for people from all over the world who are willing to work, invest and live in Hong Kong.
	- In the past two years since the implementation of the National Security Law of Hong Kong, the rule of law in Hong Kong has been effectively improved and better guaranteed. Hong Kong’s rule of law index continues to rank among the best in the world. Foreign investors’ confidence in Hong Kong has been further enhanced. of bright prospects. According to the "2022 Business Prospects Survey" released by the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong earlier this year, the number of Hong Kong-based companies that were optimistic about Hong Kong's business prospects increased by 18% compared with the previous year, while the number of pessimistic companies in Hong Kong decreased by 17%.
- The legal basis for the Chinese government to govern Hong Kong is the Chinese Constitution and the Hong Kong Basic Law, and has nothing to do with the Sino-British Joint Declaration. With the return of Hong Kong to China in 1997, the terms related to the British side stipulated in the Sino-British Joint Declaration have been fully fulfilled. The "Sino-British Joint Declaration" on the basic principles and policies towards Hong Kong is China's policy declaration, which has been fully reflected in the Basic Law formulated by the National People's Congress. China's relevant policies have not changed, and China will continue to adhere to it. The Sino-British Joint Declaration does not give Britain any responsibility for Hong Kong and the right to interfere in Hong Kong affairs after its return. The British side has no sovereignty, governance or supervision over Hong Kong after its return. The Sino-British Joint Declaration is a Sino-British bilateral document that does not involve other countries and has nothing to do with third countries. Sovereign equality and non-interference in internal affairs are the basic norms of international law and international relations. Other countries and organizations have no right to interfere in Hong Kong affairs under the guise of the Sino-British Joint Declaration.
	- The Central Government of China has always unswervingly implemented the "one country, two systems" policy. Since the return of Hong Kong, the policies of "one country, two systems", "Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong" and a high degree of autonomy have been effectively implemented and achieved universally recognized achievements. Practice has fully proved that "one country, two systems" is the best institutional arrangement to maintain Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability. The central government will continue to ensure that the "one country, two systems" policy remains unchanged and unshakable, and that the practice of "one country, two systems" is not deformed or out of shape.
- The United States ignores the objective fact that Hong Kong's democracy and what it was before the handover is not what it used to be, and moves against the mainstream public opinion of Hong Kong society's solidarity and progress, making irresponsible remarks about Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy and human rights and freedom in the tone of a democratic "teacher". This can only expose their hypocritical double-standards and their plans to disrupt Hong Kong and contain China.

### Fallacy 10: China claims to defend sovereignty and territorial integrity, but stands with the Russian government, which blatantly violates sovereignty and territorial integrity, and defends Russia.
### Facts: China has always adhered to an objective and fair position on the Ukraine issue, which is consistent with the position of most countries. The promotion of Cold War mentality and power politics is the root cause of the Ukraine crisis. The United States should earnestly shoulder its due responsibilities and take concrete actions to ease the situation and solve the problem.

- The United States has violated its commitments and continuously promoted the eastward expansion of NATO, which is the initiator of the Ukraine crisis.
	- In 1990, when the US Secretary of State Baker met with Gorbachev, he made a clear commitment that NATO "will not advance an inch to the east". However, under the leadership of the United States, NATO has expanded eastward five times since 1999, with the number of member states increasing from 16 to 30, advancing more than 1,000 kilometers eastward, reaching the Russian border and realizing a "C"-shaped encirclement of the Black Sea.
	- In 1997, former US diplomat and Soviet observer George Kennan wrote in the New York Times that NATO's continued expansion into Russia "would be the deadliest mistake of US policy in the entire post-Cold War era."
	- In 2014, former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger wrote in the "Washington Post" that if Ukraine wants to survive and develop, it should not join NATO, should not choose between the West and the East, and should not be one party against the other. "Outpost", but should become a "bridge" linking the two sides.
	- Kissinger said at the World Economic Forum 2022 annual meeting in Davos that Ukraine was supposed to be a bridge between East and West, but it has not been able to. Russia has been a vital part of Europe for 400 years, and has been the defender of the structure of the European balance of power at critical moments, and European leaders should not ignore long-term relationships.
	- An American expert on international affairs published an article pointing out that the major decision-making mistakes of the United States regarding NATO's eastward expansion have led to the deterioration of relations with Russia, and the US government should bear considerable responsibility. "Neither the United States nor NATO are innocent bystanders." He also said that it was "extremely stupid" for some U.S. officials to leak or even brag about U.S.-Ukrainian intelligence sharing. He stressed that "the US instigation of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict means a growing danger."
	- European Parliament member Claire Daly said that the United States keeps adding fuel to the fire on the Ukraine issue, its purpose is to weaken Russia and profit from it, and Europe will pay a heavy price for this. The current conflict between Russia and Ukraine continues, and there is still no hope of peace. The key reason is that "the United States does not want Russia and Ukraine to reach a peace agreement."
	- Former US Senator Bill Bradley pointed out that the biggest mistake the US made in the late 1980s and early 1990s was the eastward expansion of NATO.
	- Former U.S. Congressman Gabbard said in an interview that Biden could easily prevent a war by simply promising not to admit Ukraine to NATO, but he did not.
	- For many years, the United States has pursued interventionism and wantonly violated the sovereignty of Iraq, Afghanistan, Serbia, Syria and other countries. United Nations senior expert Alfred de Zayas said in an exclusive interview that from the perspective of international law, Russia's military operations in Ukraine violated the United Nations Charter, but many actions of the United States and NATO over the years have actually violated international law. In customary international law, a "permissive precedent" was established for current Russian behavior.
- The U.S. has been fanning the flames on the Ukraine issue. Instead of promoting peace talks, the U.S. continues to provide weapons to Ukraine, pushing the tensions to escalate, leading to the expansion, protracted, and complicated conflicts, fully exposing the selfish nature of the U.S. .
&&& - On April 25, 2022, US Secretary of Defense Austin said after a visit to Ukraine that the United States wants to use the war to "weak Russia."
	- In late May of the same year, on the basis of the original 13.6 billion US dollars in aid to Ukraine, the US Congress voted to approve the provision of more than 40 billion US dollars in military and economic assistance to Ukraine. .
	- The conflict between Russia and Ukraine has lingered to this day. When Europe is bearing heavy political, economic and social costs, the United States is reaping dividends. Arms dealers, food and energy companies have made a lot of money. For example, the market value of American industrial giants has surged by thousands The price of LNG exported to Europe is more than 10 times higher than a year ago.
	- The Russian-Ukrainian conflict has triggered an influx of more than 6.5 million Ukrainians into neighboring European countries, triggering an unprecedented refugee crisis. In March 2022, the U.S. admitted only 12 Ukrainian refugees. Thousands of Ukrainian refugees are stranded on the U.S.-Mexico border, and many are in U.S. custody. While the United Nations and the international community called for the conflict to end as soon as possible, someone in the United States said that it would "fight to the last Ukrainian".
- Sino-Russian relations are non-aligned, non-confrontational, not targeting third parties, draw ideological lines with a few Western countries such as the United States, pursue the Cold War mentality of either friend or foe, cobble together so-called "alliances", join forces to form "small circles" and cliques Politics and creating confrontation and division are fundamentally different.
	- The Sino-Russian Joint Statement issued on February 4, 2022 called for safeguarding the common values ​​of peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy, and freedom for all mankind, respecting the right of the people of all countries to independently choose the development path and the interests of the sovereignty, security and development of all countries, and defending the The international system with the United Nations at its core and the international order based on international law practice genuine multilateralism in which the United Nations and the Security Council play a central coordinating role, promote the democratization of international relations, and achieve world peace, stability and sustainable development.
- As a responsible major country, on the Ukraine issue, China insists on making an independent judgment based on the right and wrong of the matter itself. China has been striving for world peace, doing its best for international security, and working to persuade peace and talks to cool down the situation. China maintains that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries should be respected, the purposes and principles of the UN Charter should be abided by, the legitimate security concerns of all countries should be taken seriously, and all efforts conducive to the peaceful resolution of crises should be supported. China's position is objective and fair, and is in line with the aspirations of most countries.
- Of the 233 sovereign countries and regions in the world, 185 are not involved in sanctions against Russia. Among the more than 190 member states of the United Nations, more than 140 countries, including NATO member Turkey, have not participated in the sanctions against Russia. The ratio of the population of countries and regions that do not participate in the sanctions against Russia to the population of the countries that participate in the sanctions against Russia is 6.5 billion: 1.1 billion. Among them, 4.8 billion people expressly oppose sanctions.
	- About two-thirds of the world's population does not support Western positions on Ukraine, according to a survey by the British "Economist" magazine.

### Fallacy 11: The United States forms a new alliance in the "Indo-Pacific" region to strengthen peace and stability in the "Indo-Pacific" region, and launch an "Indo-Pacific Economic Framework" that promotes prosperity. The United States shares a vision with the countries and peoples of the "Indo-Pacific" region: to build a "free and open Indo-Pacific region."
### Facts: The so-called vision of the United States to build a "free and open Indo-Pacific region" is essentially a strategy to create divisions, incite confrontation, and undermine peace, which runs counter to the trend of the times for peaceful development and win-win cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region.

- The U.S. government's "Indo-Pacific strategy" says one thing and does another: it claims to promote "freedom and openness" in the region, but in fact it gathers allies to form the "Five Eyes Alliance", "Quadrilateral Mechanism", Trilateral Security Partnership, and Bilateral Alliance , the "May 4, 3, 2, 1 Chain" of the "Indo-Pacific Economic Framework", which is to close up exclusive "small circles" and force regional countries to choose sides.
	- The Trilateral Security Partnership is helping Australia develop nuclear-powered submarines, co-develop hypersonic weapons and fuel a regional arms race. Under the guise of combating illegal fishing and maintaining the resilience of the supply chain, the "Quadrilateral Mechanism" vigorously promotes military cooperation and intelligence sharing. The United States also pushed NATO to encroach on the Asia-Pacific. These are all trying to piece together an "Asia-Pacific version of NATO" and promote "integrated deterrence" against China.
- The "Indo-Pacific Strategy" has caused more and more vigilance and concern in the world, especially in the Asia-Pacific countries. According to the BBC, in April 2021, New Zealand's Foreign Minister Mahuta said that New Zealand was uncomfortable with the "Five Eyes" expanding its authority by pressuring China, and still preferred to develop bilateral relations with China. At the US-ASEAN Special Summit, ASEAN countries jointly stressed the need for peace and cooperation, not to choose sides, not to split and confront each other.
- The United States claims to ensure that the United States will win the competition in the 21st century through the "Indo-Pacific Economic Framework", indicating that the "framework" first serves the US economy. The United States has long shelved the construction of the Asia-Pacific Free Trade Area, withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, and did not participate in the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. It is entirely based on the interests of the United States. , there is no win-win.
	- The "framework" is a political tool for the United States to maintain regional economic hegemony. The essence is to deliberately exclude specific countries and politicize, weaponize, and ideologicalize economic issues by controlling supply chains and value chains and controlling new economic and new business formats. , using economic means to coerce regional countries to choose sides between China and the United States.
	- US Trade Representative Dai Qi publicly declared that the "Indo-Pacific Economic Framework" is "an arrangement independent of China." U.S. Commerce Secretary Raimondo publicly stated that the "framework" signifies the leadership of the United States to reshape the regional economy and provide regional countries with an "alternative to China" plan. Wray also said the "framework" would include harmonizing "poison pill" provisions such as export controls, such as "restricting the export of sensitive products to China".
	- The "framework" attempts to establish U.S.-led trade rules, reorganize the industrial chain system, and allow regional countries and China to "decouple and break the chain" in terms of economy and technology. Many countries in the region are worried about this and believe that "decoupling" with China will cost a lot. Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir said that any trade alliance that excludes the world's second largest economy is not conducive to strengthening "Indo-Pacific" multilateral trade cooperation, and that the United States does not include China in the "framework" not an economic issue, but a political issue .
- Although the "framework" is euphemistically called "menu-style" cooperation, it does not care about the development level and actual needs of countries in the region. It is forcing all countries to accept the so-called high standards of the United States and its own unilateral agenda. It only cares about its own concerns and ignores the needs of all parties. There is no reciprocity to speak of.
	- The Center for Strategic and International Studies of the United States released the report "The Regional Perspective of the "Indo-Pacific Economic Framework", which pointed out that the "framework" only reflects the expansion of the United States' economic presence in the region, but fails to solve the problems that regional countries are most concerned about. I worry that the "framework" is only a one-way benefit for the United States, and that regional countries will bear a heavy development burden after joining.

### Fallacy 12: China declares to establish a sphere of influence in the Pacific region, promotes illegal maritime activities in the South China Sea, undermines peace and security, freedom of navigation and commercial activities. The United States will continue to oppose China's offensive and illegal activities in the South China Sea and East China Sea. The United States will work with its allies and partners to support coastal states in the region in asserting their maritime rights and freedom of navigation and overflight, and will continue to navigate and overflight within the scope permitted by international law.
### Facts: China always adheres to the path of peaceful development, adheres to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and opposes the use of the big to bully the small and the strong to bully the weak. The US hyped up the "China threat theory" and used the so-called "freedom of navigation" as an excuse to damage China's sovereignty, security and maritime rights and interests, which is a real threat to regional peace and stability.

- China has always advocated that all countries, big or small, are equal, respect each country's choice of a development path that suits their national conditions, and never seek to establish any sphere of influence. China pursues a defensive national defense policy and a military strategy of active defense. China's military development is to safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, and is not aimed at any country. The growth of China's military power is the growth of world peace power.
- China was the first to discover, name, develop and utilize the South China Sea Islands and related waters, and was the first to continue, peacefully and effectively exercise sovereignty and jurisdiction over the South China Sea Islands and related waters. China's sovereignty over the islands in the South China Sea and related rights and interests in the South China Sea have been established in the long historical process and have sufficient historical and legal basis. They have been upheld by successive Chinese governments and have been generally recognized by the international community. After the end of World War II, in accordance with the provisions of the 1943 Cairo Declaration and the 1945 Potsdam Proclamation, China recovered the Paracel and Nansha Islands illegally occupied by Japan. Ways to declare sovereignty and strengthen jurisdiction. China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over the South China Sea Islands is not only a legitimate and legitimate inheritance of the inherent rights formed in history, but also a part of the post-World War II international order, which has been widely recognized by countries around the world, including the United States.
- At present, with the joint efforts of China and ASEAN countries, the situation in the South China Sea remains generally stable. All parties adhere to the full and effective implementation of the "Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea", strengthen dialogue, properly handle differences, deepen cooperation, enhance mutual trust, actively advance consultations on the "Code of Conduct in the South China Sea", jointly maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea, and contribute to regional and global security, stability and prosperity. positive energy. Since the outbreak, all parties have held offline senior officials' meetings on the implementation of the "Declaration", and held 10 joint working group meetings by video, and continued to advance the negotiation on the text of the "Code". Recently, all parties overcame the difficulties of the epidemic and held the first offline consultation since the epidemic in Cambodia. These positive developments fully demonstrate the determination and belief of countries in the region to firmly advance the COC consultations.
- China respects and supports the freedom of navigation and overflight enjoyed by all countries in the South China Sea in accordance with international law, and actively maintains the safety and smoothness of international shipping lanes. In fact, the South China Sea is currently one of the safest and freest sea lanes in the world. 50% of the world's merchant ships and 1/3 of the sea trade pass through this sea area, and more than 100,000 merchant ships pass through this sea area every year. Freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea has never been a problem.
- Diaoyu Dao and its affiliated islands are China's inherent territory. China's patrol and law enforcement in the waters off the Diaoyu Islands is a legitimate move by China to exercise its sovereignty in accordance with the law, and a necessary response to Japan's provocative actions. The Chinese government firmly safeguards national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and no country or force should misjudge this. At the same time, China has always been committed to properly handling and resolving issues through dialogue and consultation, and has made great efforts to stabilize the maritime situation. In 2014, China and Japan reached a four-point principled consensus on handling and improving Sino-Japanese relations, including a clear agreement on the management and control of the Diaoyu Islands and the situation in the East China Sea.
- The United States is keen on the "Monroe Doctrine", engaging in power politics and hegemonic bullying, and wantonly undermining the international maritime order in order to maintain its maritime hegemony. In the more than 240 years of history since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the United States has not fought a war for only 16 years, and has more than 800 overseas military bases in 80 countries and regions around the world. The sum of the military spending of the last nine countries. The United States recently submitted a draft defense budget of about $813 billion for fiscal year 2023. To maintain such a huge military expenditure all year round, it is the United States that poses an "imminent challenge" to the world.
- Disregarding the historical latitude and latitude and objective facts of the South China Sea issue, the United States deliberately provokes disputes over territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea, and provokes relations between countries in the region. It is the biggest destroyer of South China Sea stability and the biggest promoter of militarization of the South China Sea. According to statistics from professional institutions, the number of U.S. military reconnaissance approaches to China has more than doubled compared to a decade ago. At present, there are about 5 ships cruising offshore China every day. Since the beginning of this year, U.S. warships have crossed the Taiwan Strait once a month on average, and large-scale reconnaissance planes have approached China for more than 800 reconnaissance sorties and violated China's airspace many times. The U.S. also encouraged its allies and partners to send warships to this area, lest there would be no chaos in the South China Sea.
	- On October 2, 2021, the USS Connecticut nuclear submarine collided while snorkeling in the South China Sea. A week after the accident, the United States issued a vague statement saying that the nuclear submarine had hit an unknown object. Nearly a month after the accident, the US said it had hit an "unknown seamount". It was not until May 23, 2022 that the U.S. Navy released the final investigation report of the accident, but it still did not have any information on the navigation intention of the nuclear submarine, the specific location of the accident, whether it was in the exclusive economic zone or even territorial waters of other countries, and whether it caused nuclear leakage and damage. The marine environment and other serious concerns and doubts of the outside world shall be clearly explained.
- In 1979, the United States launched the "Freedom of Navigation Plan" before the conclusion of the "United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea", which is to protect the "freedom" of the U.S. military to the greatest extent possible in the oceans without joining the "United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea", challenging the The new ocean order. The so-called "freedom of navigation plan" does not conform to recognized international law, ignores the sovereign security and maritime rights and interests of many coastal countries, and seriously endangers regional peace and stability. Strong opposition from the broad masses of society, especially developing countries.

### Fallacy 13: Chinese government officials spread false information.
### Facts: China is the biggest victim of disinformation, and the United States is the biggest source of disinformation.

- The Republican Party and the Democratic Party in the United States are in sharp confrontation. Politicians lie, criticize each other, and blame each other. It has become a political ecology in the United States. According to a survey conducted by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the Pearson Institute at the University of Chicago, nearly half of respondents believe the U.S. government is responsible for spreading disinformation.
- The United States has repeatedly used false information to launch multiple wars and attempts to achieve hegemony around the world. U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell used a tube of "washing powder" as evidence to accuse Iraq of possessing weapons of mass destruction, and used a "white helmet" video to accuse the Syrian government of using biological and chemical weapons against its own people.
	- In 2019, the then US Secretary of State Pompeo publicly declared: "We lie, we cheat, we steal. We also have a course dedicated to teaching these. This is the glory of America's continuous exploration and progress."
	- On May 4, 2022, U.S. Republican Senator Rand Paul bluntly stated at a congressional hearing: "Do you know who is the largest disseminator of disinformation in the history of the world? The United States government."
- U.S. politicians manipulate the media, seriously undermining the credibility of the media. According to a Gallup survey in 2020, as many as 60% of the American people do not trust the media, of which 33% do not trust the media at all, 5 percentage points higher than in 2019.
- The United States has concocted a large number of lies and rumors on the origin of the new crown virus, Xinjiang-related, Tibet-related, Hong Kong-related, democracy and human rights, etc., such as "laboratory leak theory", "genocide", and "forced labor". Facts break.
	- Since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, in order to shirk responsibility for the conflict caused by NATO's eastward expansion, the United States has continuously spread false information about China and made groundless accusations and attacks on China. For example, the "New York Times" published a report citing "anonymous senior officials in the United States" as saying that China had prior knowledge of Russia's military actions against Ukraine. Greenfield, the U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations, said at a relevant meeting of the United Nations Security Council that China is spreading false information to support Russia. This is a complete slander. At the same time, the United States has aggressively blocked dissident voices, adding "special labels" to tweets that forward links to Chinese media reports, but turning a blind eye to the real fake Western media.
- The U.S. uses false information as a political tool to pressure China's attacks, and has formed an industrial chain of "black money, black opinions, and black mouths" anti-China public opinion. On the surface, anti-China remarks come from some media and politicians, but in fact, there is a huge capital-driven chain behind them. Some American and Western institutions and organizations provide political "black money" and continuously fund anti-China groups and individuals. Some think tanks and academic institutions concocted "black opinions" to shape anti-China international public opinion through the hegemony of Western discourse. Politicians and the media act as "black mouths" and widely spread lies and fallacies related to China.
	- The typical representatives of the above-mentioned "manufacturing factories" of China-related lies are Zheng Guoen and the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), the initiators of a large number of Xinjiang-related lies.
	- Zheng Guoen is actually a member of a far-right organization established by the U.S. government, and a backbone of an anti-China research organization set up by U.S. intelligence agencies. His so-called Xinjiang-related reports have no credibility, academic value, or academic integrity.
	- According to media reports, the US State Department and military enterprises are the main foreign “financiers” of ASPI. The US Department of State alone subsidizes nearly 1.4 million Australian dollars a year, all of which are used for anti-China projects. ASPI spread a series of lies and false information on issues such as virus traceability, Xinjiang-related issues, and data security.
- The US is not only accustomed to spreading false information related to China, but also, based on false information, has introduced measures to suppress and contain China, promulgated China-related decrees and imposed sanctions on China. In December 2021, the U.S. side signed the so-called "Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act" into law under the pretext of so-called "forced labor", which completely banned the import of products from Xinjiang, maliciously slandered the human rights situation in China's Xinjiang, and seriously violated international law and basic principles of international relations. guidelines.
- The Chinese side uses facts and figures to explain the truth and debunk the lies and rumors made and spread by the US side. It is not to spread false information, but to face the truth. The US does not base itself on objective facts, but based on its own interests, all remarks that are inconsistent with the US statement are called "false information", which is essentially bullying by public opinion hegemony.

### Fallacy 14: China circumvents or violates trade rules and uses economic manipulation to cost American workers millions of jobs and harm workers and companies in the United States and around the world. The United States will resist China's market-distorting behaviors such as government subsidies and entry barriers, and prevent the Chinese government from continuing to gain competitive advantages through these means.
### Facts: China has faithfully fulfilled its WTO commitments and is a defender, builder and contributor to the multilateral trading system. The nature of Sino-US economic and trade relations is mutual benefit and win-win results. The unreasonable suppression of China by the US in the fields of trade and investment is the root cause of the current Sino-US trade friction, which is harmful to others and not to itself.

- Over the past 20 years since China's accession to the WTO, China has earnestly fulfilled its WTO commitments, fully implemented the pre-establishment national treatment plus negative list management system, and continued to expand market opening. 120.
	- In October 2021, the WTO will conduct its eighth China trade policy review. The members fully recognized China's efforts in safeguarding the multilateral trading system and participating in the work of the WTO, and appreciated China's achievements in promoting trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, expanding opening up, and jointly building the "Belt and Road".
	- The head of UNCTAD said that over the past 20 years, China has always firmly supported the rules-based multilateral trading system, practiced true multilateralism, fully participated in WTO negotiations, and led negotiations on investment facilitation and e-commerce. Promote WTO rules to keep pace with the times.
- Following the general trend of international regional economic integration, China has deepened economic and trade exchanges with other countries in the world, actively signed free trade agreements with foreign businesses, and accelerated the construction of free trade zones. So far, 19 free trade agreements have been signed with 26 countries and regions.
- China has actively deepened the supply-side structural reform, and achieved the 150 million tons reduction target of the steel industry during the 13th Five-Year Plan two years ahead of schedule, accounting for 114% of the global reduction in steel production capacity. The number of steel workers in China alone is 280,000, more than the total employment in the steel industry of the United States, Europe and Japan.
- The economies of China and the United States are highly complementary, their interests are deeply integrated, and economic and trade exchanges are mutually beneficial and win-win. In 2021, China-US trade volume will reach a record $750 billion. According to the "2022 U.S. Export Report" released by the U.S.-China Business Council, in 2021, U.S. merchandise exports to China will reach $149 billion, a year-on-year increase of 21%, creating 858,000 U.S. jobs. The "2020 Business Survey Report on Chinese-funded Enterprises in the U.S." released by the China General Chamber of Commerce in the United States pointed out that as of 2019, the member companies of the China General Chamber of Commerce in the United States had invested more than US$123 billion in the United States, directly employed about 220,000 employees, and indirectly supported various parts of the United States. More than 1 million jobs. According to a study by the US-China Business Council, Chinese goods exported to the United States reduce the US price level by 1%-1.5% and help ordinary American households save $850 per year.
- The United States tried to blame China for its own economic problems, and took the opportunity to engage in a trade war and tariff war with China, but it shot itself in the foot. The U.S. tariffs on China have cost U.S. companies more than $1.7 trillion in market value, and U.S. households have increased their household spending by $1,300 a year. According to the 2021 report of the US-China Business Council, the trade war with China will lead to the loss of 245,000 US jobs. Moody's Investors Service reported that U.S. consumers bore 92.4 percent of the cost of the tariffs on Chinese goods. Nobel laureate in economics Paul Krugman believes that "the US trade policy towards China has failed completely, and the tariffs will cause more harm to the US".
	- On May 18, 2022, the National Retailers Association sent a letter to US President Biden, calling for the removal of tariffs on China, saying that it would reduce the US price index by 1.3%. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said some tariffs on China hurt U.S. consumers and businesses and could be considered to ease inflation in the U.S.
	- The current obstacles to China-US economic and trade cooperation mainly come from the US side. The U.S. has placed more than 1,000 Chinese companies on its list of unjustly suppressed and sanctioned companies, and the current Congress has put forward more than 300 negative China-related bills. The "Bipartisan Innovation Act" that is being promoted is essentially hindering China's economic development.
- The US always accuses China of its industrial subsidy policy, and it is the originator of "industrial policy" including subsidies. Many U.S. governments have formulated plans to support emerging industries, intervened in the market through tax relief, government procurement and other means to promote government-enterprise cooperation and technology transfer. In the 1950s and 1960s, the United States implemented a revitalization plan to support the development of aerospace, military and other industries. In the 1990s, the Clinton administration supported the development of high-tech industries through the "Information Superhighway" program. Such industrial policies continue to this day. The report of the Center for Strategic and International Studies of the United States pointed out that the United States and its Eurasian allies and partners are increasing subsidies to domestic semiconductors, electric vehicle batteries, pharmaceuticals and other industries to support domestic enterprises to expand.
- The US is the biggest disruptor of the global trading system. The United States pursues the "America First" policy, refuses to undertake its due obligations in multilateral trade agreements, and keeps breaking contracts and withdrawing from the group, which seriously affects the development and operation of the international trade mechanism. According to the WTO Dispute Adjudication Research Report, the United States is by far the largest "unruly player", and two-thirds of WTO violations are caused by the United States. The United States also blocked the appointment of new members to the WTO's Appellate Body, which has been completely paralyzed since December 2019.

### Fallacy 15: The US wants to give countries another option to free them from opaque investments that create debt burdens.
### Facts: China's foreign aid always respects the sovereignty of recipient countries, does not attach any conditions, insists on mutual benefit and win-win results, and brings tangible benefits to relevant developing countries, which are appreciated and thanked by relevant countries.

- The so-called China's "debt trap" is a "discourse trap" used by the US and the West to smear and smear China and interfere with China's cooperation with developing countries. The American "Atlantic Monthly" published an article in 2021, saying that the "China Debt Trap Theory" is a lie carefully fabricated by politicians in some Western countries, and it is a big lie.
	- Western capital is the largest creditor of developing countries. According to the 2022 World Bank International Debt Statistics, in the current overall external debt in Africa, the debt of multilateral financial institutions accounts for 28.8%, and the debt of commercial creditors, mainly Western financial institutions, accounts for 41.8%, and the debts held by the two account for nearly three-quarters. Africa's largest debt.
	- The head of the Center for China-Africa Studies at Johns Hopkins University in the United States said that the center reviewed thousands of documents on China's foreign loans, most of which were related to African projects, and found no evidence that China intends to force poor countries to borrow and confiscate them. assets, or seek a greater say in its internal affairs. According to the research data of the center, China's overall foreign debt in Africa accounts for 17%, which is much lower than that of the West.
	- No African country has been forced to pledge strategic resources such as ports and mines to China because of its financing cooperation with China. Germany claims that China cannot gain access to its infrastructure if African debtor countries cannot repay their debts.
- The essence of the debt problem is a development problem. The key to solving this problem is to ensure that the borrowed funds are effectively used.
	- Taking Africa as an example, Western countries’ financing to Africa is mainly concentrated in non-production areas, and most of the loans are based on political conditions such as human rights and judicial reforms. They have failed to truly promote economic development, increase government taxes, and improve the balance of payments. Become a means of "control" and "scourge" of Africa.
	- China always adheres to respecting the will of the African people, and based on the actual needs of Africa, investment and financing in Africa are mainly used for infrastructure construction and productive fields. Since the beginning of the new century, China has actively supported Africa's economic development, provided Africa with new financing channels that are different from the traditional "Paris Club", enhanced its "hematopoietic" function, improved its independent development capability, and ushered in 20 consecutive years of rapid economic growth. The "Golden Age" of the
	- Johns Hopkins University professor Deborah Brautigam pointed out that Chinese investment is diverse. In 2014 alone, Chinese companies signed more than $70 billion in contracts, benefiting the construction of important infrastructure such as hospitals, oil and gas pipelines and airports in Africa.
	- According to incomplete statistics, from 2000 to 2020, China has built more than 13,000 kilometers of roads and railways in Africa, built more than 80 large-scale power facilities, and aided the construction of more than 130 medical facilities, 45 gymnasiums, and more than 170 schools. , and trained more than 160,000 talents in various fields for Africa.
	- Chinese enterprises have invested in the construction of the Nairobi Expressway in Kenya through the government and social capital cooperation model, creating more than 6,000 local jobs and benefiting more than 200 subcontractors and hundreds of local suppliers. The Kenyan government spoke highly of this, calling it an important manifestation of the mutually beneficial and win-win cooperation between Kenya and China.
	- The Nigerian Lekki Deepwater Port project, which Chinese enterprises have participated in, has provided more than 1,200 local jobs, and is expected to directly and indirectly create 170,000 jobs after completion.
	- A survey published by Hong Kong scholars found that more than 80% of the employees employed by the Chinese companies participating in the survey were local Africans.
	- LSE research shows that Chinese investment in Africa has had a "significant and consistently positive" long-term impact.
	- According to a research report by the RAND Corporation of the United States, railway connectivity has promoted a 2.8% increase in the export value of countries along the “Belt and Road”.
- China attaches great importance to the sustainability of project debt, and signed the "Belt and Road" Financing Guiding Principles with 26 "Belt and Road" countries as early as 2017. In 2019, China released the "Belt and Road Initiative Debt Sustainability Analysis Framework", based on the debt situation and repayment ability of debtor countries, adhere to equal consultation, compliance with laws and regulations, openness and transparency, and increase the economic, social and people's livelihood benefits of the project. Supervise and evaluate, guide the flow of sovereign debt to efficient areas, and ensure the long-term benefits of the project. At the same time, China has also taken the initiative to "relieve the burden" of debtor countries.
	- World Bank research pointed out that China has carried out 71 restructuring of low-income countries' debt from 2008 to 2021. In 2020, China actively responded to the G20 debt suspension initiative. The amount of debt suspension in that year alone exceeded US$1.3 billion, accounting for nearly 30% of the G20's total debt suspension, making it the country with the largest contribution in the G20. China has signed debt suspension agreements or reached consensus on debt suspension with 19 African countries, and actively participated in the G20 common framework for the case-by-case debt settlement of Chad and Ethiopia.
- The United States and Western countries not only do not take action themselves, but also point fingers at the aid from China, which is generally dissatisfied by the vast number of developing countries.
	- In an interview with the Global Times, Professor Heidiger, consultant of the Sri Lanka National Education Council, said: "The loans provided by China are all based on the needs of the Sri Lankan government to improve our infrastructure, and these loans have brought great benefits to our economy and people's livelihood. Great changes, there is no so-called 'debt trap'. And Chinese loans only account for about 10% of Sri Lanka's total debt, some media apparently choose to ignore this." "Western media will hype the 'China debt trap' at first glance It seems to be reasonable, but in fact, the huge economic value of economic development, employment, and investment attraction brought about by the improvement of infrastructure is deliberately hidden."
	- On January 17, 2022, Sri Lanka's "Daily News" published an article "The development of Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal needs China", saying, "South Asian countries need China in the process of development, because China is synonymous with 'development'. China's 'One Belt, One Road' initiative has brought benefits to almost all South Asian countries." The article said: "As far as Sri Lanka is concerned, we are the beneficiaries of Chinese projects, and many people will only hype the 'China debt trap' in this regard, but No one mentions the development that China's investment in Sri Lanka's seaports, airports, national roads and distribution centers has brought us."
	- Ugandan President Museveni said in an interview with the Nikkei Asian Review magazine in 2022 that Africa has had a "debt trap" problem for the past 600 years, caused by the slave trade, colonialism and neo-colonialism, among which None are from China. China once supported the African people in their resistance to colonialism, and only later began to engage in economic activities in Africa.
	- Rwandan President Kagame pointed out that China is different from other countries in participating in African affairs and has never forced any country to lend to them to accumulate debts.
	- Nigerian Foreign Minister Onyeama said that Nigeria chose Chinese companies to build infrastructure because Chinese companies have rich experience and high cost performance, and China has not used the project to exert so-called "influence".

### Fallacy 16: For a long time, Chinese companies have enjoyed market access in the U.S. far beyond what U.S. companies have enjoyed in China. U.S. companies operating in China often experience systematic forced technology transfers, but Chinese companies operating in the U.S. are protected by U.S. law.
### Facts: China has always been committed to creating a market-oriented, legalized, and international business environment, and the business environment has been continuously optimized. In contrast, the business environment for Chinese-funded companies in the United States continues to deteriorate.

- China is the economy with the largest improvement in the business environment. In recent years, China has continuously reduced the negative list for foreign investment access, improved investment promotion and protection, information reporting and other systems, strengthened intellectual property protection, and has become one of the world's fastest-growing economies in terms of business environment. The continuous improvement of China's business environment and the attractiveness of the super-large market have created a strong magnet for global cross-border investment, and the number of newly established foreign-invested enterprises has achieved steady growth. From 2012 to 2021, the number of foreign-invested enterprises in China increased from 441,000 to 664,000, an increase of more than 50%. According to the "2020 Doing Business Report" released by the World Bank, China's business environment ranked 31st globally, up 47 places in two years. According to the "Business Confidence Survey 2021" released by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, more than half of the EU companies surveyed believe that China's intellectual property enforcement is "good enough" and "very good", setting a record high of satisfaction.
- Whether China's business environment is good or not, foreign companies, including US companies, have the most say. According to the 2022 "China Business Environment Survey Report" by the American Chamber of Commerce in China, 58% of US companies in China will achieve revenue growth in 2021, 66% of companies plan to increase investment in China this year, and China is still 60% of companies' recent global investment plans one of the top three investment destinations. According to the "2021 China Business Environment Survey Report" released by the US-China Business Council, 95% of the surveyed companies continue to maintain profitability in China, and 74% of the surveyed companies regard China as the most important country or ranking in their global strategies One of the top five key countries. From January to April 2022, the actual U.S. investment in China increased by 53.2% year-on-year. All these fully demonstrate that foreign companies are optimistic about China's economic development prospects, recognize China's business environment, and have full confidence in taking root in the Chinese market for a long time.
- In order to safeguard its hegemony and economic interests, the United States violates the principles of market economy and international trade rules, abuses its national power, and uses any means to suppress and contain Chinese companies. The US government tries to suppress Xinjiang's cotton, tomato and solar photovoltaic industries by fabricating "forced labor" and other lies. According to incomplete statistics, in 2021, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection has issued 7 suspension orders for goods exported to the United States involving "forced labor", including cotton products such as clothing and textiles produced in Xinjiang, tomato seeds, canned tomatoes, tomatoes Sauce and other tomato products, silicon-based products, electronic products, etc., detained and confiscated a total of about $485 million worth of goods, a significant increase in both volume and value compared to 2020. The current US administration has surpassed the previous administration in both the number and intensity of sanctions against China on Xinjiang-related issues.
- The U.S. imposes all-round restrictions on Chinese companies' financing and operations in the U.S. with opaque and unfair administrative measures. According to official U.S. statistics, the U.S. has so far included 1,055 Chinese entities and individuals (excluding overseas affiliated entities) on various sanctions lists. Among them, 467 are on the entity list, 306 are on the list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons (SDN list), 201 are on the unverified list, 68 are on the list of Chinese military-industrial complex enterprises, and a few other entities. In February of this year, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) included China’s WeChat and AliExpress on the “Notorious Markets List”, and continued to include Chinese companies such as Pinduoduo and 9 Chinese physical markets on the list.

### Fallacy 17: China uses the openness of the U.S. economy to engage in espionage, hacking, technology theft and other activities to promote its own military innovation, strengthen internal surveillance, and increase other countries' dependence on its technology. America should make technology rooted in democratic values.
### The truth: China's technological innovation and development rely on its own investment and efforts. The US draws ideological lines in scientific and technological exchanges and cooperation, which is a manifestation of the Cold War mentality.

- China is a major global innovation country, leading the world in terms of innovation investment scale and growth rate. According to statistics, in 2021, China's entire society's R&D investment will reach 2,786.4 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 14.2%, and a total of 696,000 invention patents will be authorized, a year-on-year increase of 31.3%. According to the 2021 Global Innovation Index (GII) Report of the World Intellectual Property Organization, the comprehensive ranking of China's national innovation capability has risen from 35th to 12th. China has 19 global top 100 technology clusters, ranking second in the world. The number of international patent applications submitted by Chinese applicants reached 69,500, ranking first in the world for three consecutive years. Statistics from the European Patent Office show that a total of 16,665 patent applications will be received from China in 2021, a year-on-year increase of 24%, the highest increase among major patent application countries.
- In recent years, China has actively integrated into the global scientific and technological innovation network, and the “Belt and Road” scientific and cultural exchanges have achieved fruitful results. China has also actively promoted the process of joining the Hague Agreement and the Marrakesh Treaty, contributing its strength to the global governance of intellectual property rights. According to the "Business Confidence Survey 2021" released by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, more than half of the companies surveyed believe that China's intellectual property enforcement is "good enough" or "very good".
- Historically, the United States has repeatedly stole intellectual property rights by spying on intelligence, attracting immigrants, and monopolizing patents to capture technological dividends.
	- After World War II, the United States used the "paperclip" operation to search for German patents on advanced aircraft, guided missile control and other technologies, looting almost all German government departments, R&D institutions, and large enterprises, and forcing German scientists to immigrate to the United States. In the 1990s, U.S. intelligence agencies installed eavesdropping devices on the cars of Japanese auto trade negotiators to gain internal intelligence and win the initiative in negotiations. In 2001, European Airbus sued Boeing for stealing trade secrets by tracking phone calls, faxes, and emails of Airbus employees with the help of the NSA's "echelon" electronic monitoring system. In 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice detained four senior executives of Alstom, a French company, and coerced Alstom to sell core businesses such as electricity and power grids to General Electric at low prices. In 2021, the Danish media revealed that the US National Security Agency used the Internet facilities in Denmark to monitor senior officials and entrepreneurs from European countries. In the name of coping with the shortage of chips, the United States has also forced chip giants in various countries to hand over key information such as orders, customer information, and inventory within a time limit, seeking to reverse the United States' disadvantage in the chip industry.
- The United States advertises "freedom" and "openness", but it sets up technical barriers at every turn, piecing together the so-called "democratic science and technology alliance", politicizing and ideological science and technology issues, and creating a closed and exclusive "small circle". The United States has designated nearly 20 key control technologies such as biotechnology and artificial intelligence, strengthened export controls, strictly reviewed investment, and generalized the concept of "national security". Violating the right of developing countries to develop science and technology.

### Fallacy 18: The climate problem is not an ideological problem, it is a mathematical problem. If China sticks to its current plan of not reducing emissions by 2030, then the rest of the world will have to drop to zero by 2035, which is basically impossible.
### Facts: The United States has an inescapable responsibility for global climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The United States should not shift the responsibilities and should not pursue "double standards".

- Disorderly emission of developed countries in the process of industrialization over the past 200 years, bears an inescapable historical responsibility for global climate change. From 1850 to 2011, developed countries accounted for 79% of global carbon emissions. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement all require developed countries to repay their historical debts.
- From the perspective of historical development, developing countries are not the main emitters of greenhouse gases, but the victims of climate warming. The principle of common but differentiated responsibilities is the cornerstone of global climate governance. Developed and developing countries have different historical responsibilities in causing climate change, and there are also differences in development needs and capabilities. It is inappropriate and unfair to use a unified scale to limit. Papua New Guinea's Environment Minister Weera Murray said on the sidelines of the 26th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP26): "Because of their (developed countries') industrialization activities, we are victims of global climate issues. are suffering from the climate consequences they create. This is absolutely not fair.”
- In addressing climate change, China is not only a serious and responsible participant, but also a down-to-earth activist. President Xi Jinping clearly stated that China's carbon dioxide emissions will peak by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. The time limit is only 30 years, while the time specified by the EU, the United States and Japan is 2.4 times and 1.4 times that of China, respectively. times and 1.2 times.
	- China's contribution to energy conservation, energy efficiency improvement, development of renewable energy, transportation, construction and other fields basically accounts for 30%-50% of the global total, and the contribution is obvious. By the end of 2020, China's carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP had decreased by about 48.4% compared with 2005. The proportion of coal consumption dropped from 67% in 2005 to 56.8% in 2020. China's cumulative installed capacity of renewable energy power generation exceeds 1 billion kilowatts, accounting for 43.5% of the country's total installed power generation capacity. 15 of the top 20 global photovoltaic companies are Chinese companies, and the top five are all Chinese companies. Seven of the top ten wind power companies in the world are Chinese companies. China has phased out 120 million kilowatts of thermal power in the past 10 years, exceeding the current total installed capacity of power generation in the UK. By the end of 2021, the number of new energy vehicles in China will reach 7.84 million, of which 2.95 million will be newly registered in 2021, accounting for 11.25% of the total number of newly registered vehicles.
	- China's share of renewable energy has surpassed that of the United States. At the end of 2019, China's hydropower, wind power, photovoltaic installed capacity reached 756 million kilowatts, 2.8 times that of the United States. Renewable energy accounts for 12.7% of primary energy consumption in China, about 1.4 times that of the United States.
- The United States is the country with the largest cumulative greenhouse gas emissions in the world, with per capita carbon emissions 3.3 times the global average. In the 270 years from 1750 to 2019, the United States cumulatively emitted 412.5 billion tons of greenhouse gases, accounting for about a quarter of the global total, making it the largest cumulative country in the world and nearly twice that of China. The data shows that the historical record of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States is 23.44 tons per capita. The per capita emissions in the United States in 2018 were 16.85 tons, while the figure in China was 7.56 tons. As a major manufacturing country, China's current per capita carbon emissions are less than half that of the United States, and the historical cumulative emissions per capita are about one-eighth of the United States. Even if China achieves its carbon peak in 2030, China's per capita carbon emissions will only be roughly 7-8 tons, but the per capita carbon emissions in the United States reached 14 tons in 2005.
- In June 2017, the United States announced that it would withdraw from the Paris Agreement, and formally withdrew from the agreement in November 2020, greatly undermining the fairness, efficiency and effectiveness of global environmental governance. In February 2021, the United States officially rejoined the Paris Agreement. Although its political posture has recovered, its greenhouse gas emissions cannot go back. The emissions in 2021 will not decrease but increase compared with 2020, which is farther and farther away from the requirements of the Paris Agreement. The US has been capricious on issues related to the overall future and destiny of the world, fully revealing its pragmatic attitude on major issues of principle, and has broken its trust in the global family.
- Providing funds to developing countries to help them better cope with climate change is an inescapable moral responsibility of developed countries. At the 2009 Copenhagen and 2010 Cancun conferences, developed countries pledged to jointly mobilize $100 billion a year by 2020 to help developing countries tackle climate change. However, for more than a decade, developed countries have never really fulfilled this commitment. The report of an internationally renowned think tank shows that the annual climate contribution provided by developed countries not only fails to meet the standard, but also has problems such as "mixing with water" and "making up the number", and the actual effective funds provided are far lower than the official data. In particular, the United States only completed less than 20% of its share.
- The United States has publicly expressed its desire to cooperate with China on climate change for many years, but it has contradicted itself in its actions. While the United States requires China to control coal consumption, it also requires China to continue importing coal from the United States; it proposes to develop renewable energy while sanctioning Chinese photovoltaic companies. Taking photovoltaic products as an example, since 2012, the United States has imposed anti-dumping and countervailing duties on Chinese photovoltaic products, with tax rates as high as 34%-47%. In December 2014, the United States conducted a "dual-reverse" investigation of Chinese photovoltaic manufacturers. In January 2018, the previous U.S. administration decided to impose global safeguard tariffs on $8.5 billion in imported solar panels. At the end of 2021, the United States signed the so-called "Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act" into law, attacking the photovoltaic industry in Xinjiang under the guise of human rights. The relevant measures of the United States not only suppress the normal trade of photovoltaic products and disrupt the normal supply chain, but also undermine the global efforts to combat climate change. The US should correct its mistakes and create a favorable environment for China-US climate cooperation.
- The current climate change has brought severe challenges to human survival and development, which requires the joint efforts of all countries. Developed countries, including the United States, should earnestly follow the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, face up to their historical responsibilities in accordance with the requirements of the Paris Agreement, demonstrate greater ambition and action, and take the lead in drastic emission reductions, which will be achieved as early as 2050. To be carbon neutral, and to leave due development and emission space for developing countries, and to implement the commitment to provide developing countries with adequate funding, technology and capacity-building support. On the basis of fulfilling investment commitments and giving play to the guiding role of public funds, actively develop green finance and guide social investment to flow to low-carbon fields. All parties should also actively establish national, regional and global carbon markets and carbon pricing mechanisms, reduce the cost of emission reduction, increase emission reduction efforts, promote technological innovation and sustainable development, and use the carbon market revenue-sharing mechanism to help developing countries adapt to carbon dioxide emissions. Provide a stable source of funding for changes and capacity building.

### Fallacy 19: In the fight against illicit drugs, especially synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, we want to work with China to prevent international drug trafficking organizations from obtaining chemical precursors, many of which originate in China.
### THE FACTS: The root cause of the fentanyl abuse problem in the United States lies within the United States itself.

- The proliferation of drugs is a stubborn disease that has plagued the United States for a long time, with profound historical and social roots.
	- The United States, with 5% of the world's population, consumes 80% of the world's opioids, and is the world's largest drug consumption market. There is a widespread tradition of abusing prescription painkillers in the United States. Behind it is a complete chain of interests of pharmaceutical companies, pharmaceutical representatives, and doctors. Pharmaceutical companies vigorously sell, doctors indiscriminately prescribe, government crackdowns, and the negative orientation of marijuana legalization are intertwined. , eventually resulting in the continued expansion of the drug consumption market. The rise in opioid abuse and deaths in the U.S. originated in 1995 when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved OxyContin, an opioid pain reliever made by Purdue Pharmaceuticals. The U.S. can do more to curb demand and control production.
	- The United States, as the country with the most prominent fentanyl problem in the world, is also the largest producer and user of fentanyl drugs in the world. Requirements, this is a typical "I am sick, but let others take medicine."
- The Chinese government has always adhered to a "zero tolerance" attitude towards the drug issue, and strictly controls various types of narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances and their chemical precursors. By the end of 2021, China has regulated 37 precursor chemicals and ephedrine substances, exceeding the number regulated by the United Nations, and has been strictly monitoring the import and export of chemicals in accordance with international rules and Chinese laws. The results are obvious to all.
	- On May 1, 2019, the Chinese government took the lead in the world to officially list all fentanyl-like substances under the circumstance that large-scale abuse has not yet occurred in China and the actual harm is not prominent. This is in the process of implementation. The important achievement of the consensus reached by the two US heads of state is also a concrete manifestation of China's active response to the US' concerns and efforts to help the US deal with the domestic opioid crisis from the height of the health, safety and well-being of all mankind.
	- China has also implemented the three systems of “real-name receipt and delivery, receipt and delivery inspection, and airport security inspection” in the delivery industry, and strengthened cross-border parcel inspections involving the United States and other key regions, and severely cracked down on fentanyl and other listed chemicals Trafficking has achieved remarkable results.
	- After the entire class of fentanyl-like substances was listed, the National Narcotics Control Commission and the Ministry of Public Security of China have maintained close, candid and in-depth cooperation with partners such as the White House Office of Drug Policy, the State Department's International Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Drug Enforcement Administration. Since September 2019, the US has not seized any fentanyl-like substances from China. The U.S. side has expressed its gratitude to the Chinese side on multiple occasions, and has repeatedly emphasized that China-U.S. cooperation in drug control is the highlight of the law enforcement cooperation between the two countries.
	- It is well known that the responsibility for preventing the influx of non-scheduled chemicals into drug production lies with the importing country. However, the United States does not officially list fentanyl-like substances, and does not solve the domestic demand problem. On the contrary, it confuses right and wrong, falsely claiming that "the chemical precursors for drug production by drug trafficking organizations are from China", and blindly blames the blame for non-scheduled substances. This is not only for ulterior motives, but also extremely irresponsible for the lives and health of the American people.
- In May 2020, in the absence of any evidence, the United States added China's Ministry of Public Security's Physical Evidence Identification Center and the National Drug Laboratory to the "entity list" for sanctions. On the one hand, it requires China to cooperate, and on the other hand, it imposes sanctions on the Chinese anti-drug department, which seriously hinders the normal operation of China's monitoring system for fentanyl-like substances and seriously affects China-US anti-drug cooperation.
	- Under the circumstance that the control of fentanyl-like substances in the international community and China is becoming more and more strict, the problem of mefentanyl continues to deteriorate, and the number of deaths has not declined but increased, indicating that the United States has not found the crux of the abuse of fentanyl. The Chinese side has repeatedly reminded the US side in good faith to strengthen the supervision of fentanyl drug prescriptions and strengthen publicity and education. These are effective practices recognized by the international community.

### Fallacy 20: At a time when the global food crisis threatens people around the world, we look to China, a country that has made great achievements in agriculture, to help the world respond.
### Facts: The United States has long restricted grain exports and monopolized grain trade. After the outbreak of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, the United States expanded its arms assistance and abused unilateral sanctions, further aggravating the global food shortage and taking an inescapable responsibility for the global food crisis.

- De-globalization, energyization and trade oligarchy of U.S. food are the root causes of global food security problems.
	- The United States took advantage of its status as a major grain-producing country to restrict grain exports to other countries and continued to crack down on normal global grain trade. The total amount of grain produced and exported by 12 major grain-producing regions such as the United States, Canada and the European Union accounts for 70% of the world's total. From the perspective of global trade relations, the decision-making power of whether developing countries can buy grain and at what price is controlled by the developed countries in the United States and the West.
	- The United States consumes food to produce biofuels, which has an impact on the global food supply, especially the ration supply. Nearly one-third of the corn produced in the United States is used for biofuels. This creates a competitive substitution for the global food supply, creating a vicious circle in which food and energy prices push each other up.
	- The four major grain suppliers of ADM, Bunge, Gagie and Louis Dreyfus monopolize more than 80% of the world's grain trade, control all aspects of global agricultural raw materials, grain production, processing and supply, and master international grain pricing power, Taking advantage of global food price fluctuations to make excess profits, three of which are from the United States. Since 2021, the net income of the four major grain merchants has increased by 53%, 80%, 64% and 47.7% respectively, and the share prices of ADM and Bunge have nearly tripled. These international food oligarchs are fundamentally oriented to the pursuit of profit, and do not miss any opportunity to hype food security issues and exaggerate food supply tensions in order to make huge profits.
- The U.S.'s arrogance of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the abuse of economic sanctions are the "culprits" that exacerbate the global food shortage.
	- The protracted conflict between Russia and Ukraine is a direct result of the constant fighting between the United States and the West. At present, U.S. military and weapons assistance to Ukraine has increased to $53.6 billion, more than 70% of the combined military spending of Russia and Ukraine in 2021. The longer the war drags on and the bigger the battlefield is, the bigger the impact on global food production and supply will be, and the food crisis will intensify.
	- In the face of the global food crisis, major grain-producing countries such as the United States have tightened their “grain bags” instead. The USDA forecast in its May 2022 supply and demand report that U.S. wheat exports in 2021-22 will be 18.9% lower than the previous year. According to the research results of the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), after the outbreak of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, the global share of restricted food trade has greatly increased, and the current restricted proportion has risen to 17%.
	- The U.S. food security initiative is too much and too little, but it has led to the "fragmentation" of global food security governance. Russia is the world's main exporter of grain rations and the largest exporter of fertilizers. Since the United States and the West imposed sanctions on Russia, the global price index of various fertilizers has risen by more than 30%, which has seriously affected agricultural production. From 2021 to 2022, Russian wheat exports will account for 16% of global exports, and barley exports will account for 12.9% of global exports. The global food price index rose 14 percent in May 2022 from February, since the U.S. initiated sanctions on Russia, data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations showed.
- The serious problem of food waste in the United States has made global food shortages worse.
	- One is the staggering amount of waste. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 30%-40% of food is wasted in the United States every year, and 38% of grains are wasted. The total amount of food wasted in the United States in 2018 reached 103 million tons, worth $161 billion. In 2020, the per capita food waste in the United States reached 59 kilograms.
	- Second, the distribution is uneven. About 38 million people in the United States are food insecure in 2020, mainly black, Latino and Native American groups. According to National Geographic, the U.S. government has introduced the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), but more than one-third of the lowest-income households cannot enjoy it, and the subsidy does not meet the standards of healthy, adequate diets for many families in high-cost areas of the United States .
	- Third, secondary problems are prominent. Every year, the United States causes staggering waste of resources and environmental burden due to overproduction of food, including 140 million mu of arable land, 22 trillion liters of water, 350 million kilograms of pesticides, and 6.35 million tons of chemical fertilizers.
- China has made significant contributions to world food security. China uses less than 9% of the world's land to achieve about a quarter of the world's food production and feed one-fifth of the world's population. At the same time, China has put forward a global development initiative, which regards food security as one of the eight key areas of cooperation. It will mobilize all parties around the world, promote complementary advantages, and gather maximum synergy for the realization of all sustainable development goals, including food security. The initiative has received positive responses from more than 100 countries around the world and international organizations such as the United Nations.
- The Chinese people cherish food and have always pursued the traditional virtue of diligence and thrift. President Xi Jinping attaches great importance to food security, advocates the social customs of "practice economy and oppose waste", and has repeatedly emphasized the need to stop food waste. Since the nationwide launch of "Operation CD-ROM" in 2013, the "waste on the tip of the tongue" has significantly improved. According to the data of "Nature" magazine, the amount of food dumped by Chinese catering establishments has decreased by 40%. In 2021, China will host the International Conference on Food Loss Reduction, which has received positive responses from the international community, including members of the G20.
- China is an important strategic partner for the South-South Cooperation of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. In recent years, China has donated US$130 million to the FAO South-South Cooperation Fund. China has sent more than 1,100 agricultural experts and technicians to more than 40 countries and regions, and trained nearly 100,000 farmers. China is the developing country with the largest amount of financial assistance, the largest number of experts and the largest number of projects under the South-South Cooperation Framework of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.
- China provides a Chinese solution to the global food shortage problem. China's hybrid rice has been popularized in dozens of countries and regions in Asia, Africa and the Americas, with an annual planting area of ​​8 million hectares, increasing the world's total grain volume by 150 million tons and feeding 400-500 million more people. "Father of Chinese Hybrid Rice" Yuan Longping and other Chinese researchers went to India, Pakistan, Vietnam, Myanmar, Bangladesh and other countries to provide advice and consultation, and trained more than 14,000 hybrid rice for more than 80 developing countries through international training courses Professional and technical personnel.

### Fallacy 21: China has perfected mass surveillance and exported related technologies to more than 80 countries.
### Fact: The United States is the largest "Matrix" in the world.

- The use of video surveillance and big data technology is an important measure taken by the Chinese government to improve social governance, and it is also a common practice in countries around the world today. The "Skynet System" made with the video surveillance system effectively eliminates the hidden dangers of public security and effectively guarantees the detection rate of criminal cases in China. Under the construction of the information-based social security prevention and control system, the national sense of security will reach 98.6% in 2021, and China has become one of the safest countries in the world. According to the Gallup Global Security Country Ranking, China ranks third, while the United States ranks 36th.
- According to statistics, there were about 70 million cameras installed in the United States in 2018, with about 4.6 people per camera. The US accusing China of mass surveillance is a complete double standard.
- For a long time, the United States has violated international law and basic norms of international relations by conducting large-scale, organized and indiscriminate cyber theft, surveillance and attacks on foreign governments, enterprises and individuals. In June 2013, the British "Guardian" and the American "Washington Post" successively reported that the US National Security Agency began to implement a secret electronic surveillance program, the Prism Program, since 2007, and the surveillance targets even included US allies. Germany's "Der Spiegel" weekly reported that US intelligence agencies have conducted surveillance activities against the German Chancellor for nearly 10 years.
- In 2020, the Irish Data Protection Commission asked Facebook to stop transferring EU user data to the US. The European Court of Justice previously ruled that data transfer standards between the European Union and the United States did not adequately protect the privacy of EU citizens, who lacked an effective way to deal with U.S. government surveillance. Media reports say agencies such as the U.S. National Security Agency can demand that Internet companies such as Facebook and Google hand over EU citizens’ data without their knowledge.
- In December 2020, the French National Council for Information and Freedom stated that the French websites of Google and Amazon had stored data stored when visitors browsed the web without prior permission, without specifying their purpose, in violation of French laws and regulations. Regulation.
- In 2021, the Danish National Broadcasting Corporation (DR) reported that between 2012 and 2014, the NSA used Danish information cables to eavesdrop on (surveillance) high-ranking officials in Sweden, Norway, France and Germany, including Germany Former Chancellor Angela Merkel and many other dignitaries. The US has apparently broken its promise to no longer monitor Merkel.
- The United States is a veritable Matrix Empire, an empire of eavesdropping, and an empire of secret stealing by abusing its leading edge in Internet and communications technology. From "Prism Gate", "Angel of Wrath Project", "Starwind Project", to "Operation Telescreen", "Hive" platform and quantum attack system, the United States has violated the freedom of communication and speech of its citizens through digital surveillance, and it has been widely used in the world. Engage in cyber attacks and eavesdropping. The U.S. "Prime Class" project exposed by Snowden shows that the U.S. has secretly installed monitoring equipment in its nearly 100 embassies and consulates abroad to steal secrets from the host country.
- In 2020, the Chinese cybersecurity company 360 released the APT-C-39 report, exposing that APT-C-39, a cyber-attack organization of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, had targeted Chinese aerospace, scientific research institutions, the oil industry, large Internet companies and government agencies. and other key areas for 11 years of network penetration attacks. The above-mentioned attacks have seriously damaged China's national security, economic security, critical infrastructure security and the security of the general public's personal information.
	- In 2022, according to the "Prelude to Cyber ​​Warfare: The National Security Agency (APT-C-40) Launched Indiscriminate Attacks on the World for More than a Decade" released by 360 Company, the National Security Agency used cyber weapons to attack China, 403 targets in 47 countries and regions around the world, including the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Poland, Japan, India, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, South Africa, and Brazil, carried out cyber attacks.
	- On April 19, 2022, the National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center of China issued an early warning and a related report on the U.S. government’s cyberattacks against various countries, exposing the “lightweight” cyberweapons dedicated to the U.S. government and the deployment of networks around the world. Attack the platform, and set up multi-layer springboard servers and VPN tunnels in France, Germany, Canada, Turkey, Malaysia and other countries.
