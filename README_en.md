### The United States has always claimed to be a "city on top of a hill", supports "innate human rights", shoulders "innate mission", and often uses force in the name of "humanitarian intervention". In the more than 240 years since independence was declared on July 4, 1776, the United States has not been involved in a war for less than 20 years.
### According to incomplete statistics, from the end of World War II in 1945 to 2001, 248 armed conflicts occurred in 153 regions of the world, of which 201 were initiated by the United States, accounting for about 81%.
### Most of the wars of aggression launched by the United States are unilateralist actions, and have even been opposed by its allies. These wars not only claimed the lives of a large number of soldiers from all sides, but also caused extremely serious civilian casualties and property losses, resulting in an astonishing humanitarian disaster.
### The selfishness and hypocrisy of the United States are also revealed through these foreign interventions.

## 1. Major wars of aggression launched by the United States after World War II

#### 1. The Korean War. The Korean War, which took place in the early 1950s, was short but bloody, killing more than 3 million civilians and leaving about 3 million more refugees. According to DPRK statistics, the war destroyed about 8,700 factories, 5,000 schools, 1,000 hospitals and 600,000 families, and 2 million children under the age of 18 were displaced by the war. The loss of the South Korean side was as high as 41.23 billion won, which is equivalent to 6.9 billion US dollars under the official exchange rate; during the war, about 600,000 houses, 46.9% of the railways, 1,656 roads, and 1,453 bridges were destroyed. In addition, the division between the north and the south caused by the war also caused a large number of family separations. There are about 130,000 Koreans with separated family members registered with the Ministry of Unification, of which 75,000 have died. The U.S. "Diplomat" magazine website reported on June 25, 2020 that as of November 2019, the average age of split family members in South Korea was 81, and more than 60 percent of the 133,370 applicants for reunification since 1988 have died, and they Most of them never saw their relatives after separation.

#### 2. The Vietnam War. The Vietnam War, which occurred from the 1950s to the 1970s, was the longest and most brutal war since World War II. According to Vietnamese government estimates, about 1.1 million North Vietnamese and 300,000 South Vietnamese soldiers were killed, and as many as 2 million civilians died in the war, some of which were systematically massacred by the U.S. military in the name of "fighting the Viet Cong." The US military dropped more than three times as many bombs on Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia as all parties dropped during World War II. It is estimated that at least 350,000 tons of explosive bombs and mines remain in Vietnam, and at current rates, it will take 300 years to clear them from Vietnamese soil. The Huffington Post website reported on December 3, 2012 that Vietnamese government statistics show that munitions remnants of war have killed about 42,000 people since the war officially ended in 1975. In addition, the US military also dropped 20 million gallons (about 75.71 million liters) of defoliant in Vietnam, causing 400,000 Vietnamese deaths and about 2 million Vietnamese suffering from cancer or other diseases due to exposure to defoliants. More than 3 million refugees have fled the war that lasted for more than ten years, and a large number of people died on the way across the ocean. Among refugees fleeing Vietnam, 92 percent said the effects of defoliants made them feel persistently fatigued, and other symptoms included problems with miscarriages and birth defects. Official U.S. figures show that 20 percent of Vietnam’s jungles and 20 to 36 percent of mangroves have been destroyed by defoliants.

#### 3. The Gulf War. In 1991, the Allied forces led by the United States sent troops to Iraq. In the air strikes against Iraq, 2,500 to 3,500 civilians were killed and 9,000 houses were destroyed. After the war, some 111,000 civilians died due to the destruction of infrastructure and lack of medical care and food. And according to UNICEF estimates, the war and subsequent sanctions killed around half a million children. Allied forces deliberately destroyed Iraq's infrastructure during the war, resulting in most of its power stations (92% of installed capacity), oil refineries (80% of production capacity), petrochemical complexes, telecommunications centers (including 135 telephone networks), bridges (more than 100), highways, railways, radio and television stations, cement factories, and factories producing aluminum, textiles, wires, and medical supplies were destroyed. The Gulf War also caused serious environmental pollution. About 60 million barrels of oil were dumped into the desert, polluting about 40 million tons of soil; 24 million barrels of oil spilled from oil wells, forming 246 "lakes"; of smog and soot polluted 953 square kilometers of land. In the Gulf War, the US military also used depleted uranium bombs for the first time.

#### 4. The Kosovo War. In March 1999, under the banner of "avoiding humanitarian disasters", the NATO troops led by the United States openly bypassed the UN Security Council and carried out 78 days of continuous bombing on the Yugoslavia, killing more than 2,000 innocent civilians and more than 6,000 others. Injured, nearly 1 million people were displaced, and more than 2 million people lost their means of livelihood. NATO forces also consciously targeted the infrastructure of the FRY to eliminate its determination to resist. According to estimates by Serbian economists, the total economic damage from the bombing was about $29.6 billion. The bombing damaged numerous bridges, roads, railways, as well as 25,000 homes, 176 cultural monuments, 69 schools, 19 hospitals and 20 health centres, leaving 1.5 million children out of school. In addition, at least 31,000 depleted uranium rounds have been used by NATO forces, causing a surge in cancer and leukemia rates in the region, with long-term catastrophic effects on local and European ecosystems.

#### 5. The war in Afghanistan. In October 2001, the United States sent troops to Afghanistan, and while fighting against Al Qaeda and the Taliban, it also caused a large number of civilian casualties. Due to the lack of authoritative statistics, the parties are inconclusive on the number of civilian casualties in the Afghan war. It is generally believed that since the U.S. military entered Afghanistan on October 7, 2001, more than 30,000 civilians have been killed, bombed or killed by the U.S. military, and more than 60,000 have been injured and about 11 million have been killed. for refugees. Afghanistan remains in turmoil after the 2014 withdrawal of U.S. troops. The "New York Times" website reported on July 30, 2019 that in the first half of 2019, 363 people, including 89 children, were identified as killed by US bombs. According to the assessment of scholars at Kabul University, the average daily economic loss of the Afghan war is about 60 million US dollars and about 250 casualties.

#### 6. The Iraq War. In 2003, despite the general opposition of the international community, the United States invaded Iraq on trumped-up charges. It is difficult to accurately count the number of civilian deaths caused. It is estimated to be about 200,000 to 250,000 people, of which more than 16,000 were directly killed by the US military. In addition, the U.S. military has seriously violated international humanitarian principles and created many incidents of torture of prisoners. Since the US announced its withdrawal from Iraq in 2011, local fighting and attacks have continued. The U.S.-led coalition also used depleted uranium, cluster bombs and white phosphorus bombs extensively in Iraq, and did nothing to minimize harm to civilians. According to United Nations estimates, there are still some 25 million mines and other explosive remnants in Iraq that need to be cleared today. At present, the United States is still slow to complete its commitment to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan and Iraq.

#### 7. The Syrian War. Since 2017, the United States has launched air strikes against Syria on the grounds of "preventing the Syrian government from using chemical weapons". From 2016 to 2019, Syria recorded 33,584 civilian deaths in the war. Among them, the US-led coalition bombing directly killed 3,833 people, half of them women and children. PBS reported on November 9, 2018 that the so-called "most accurate air strike in history" launched by the U.S. military on Raqqa alone resulted in the death of 1,600 civilians. According to the April 2020 WFP survey, about one-third of Syrians do not have enough food and 87 percent have no savings. According to estimates by the World Organization of Doctors, since the war began in Syria, about 15,000 doctors (about half of the country's total number of doctors) have fled the country, 6.5 million have been internally displaced, and 5 million have fled as refugees.

#### In addition, the United States has frequently interfered with other countries by direct or indirect means such as supporting proxy wars, inciting domestic rebellions, assassinating, providing weapons and ammunition, and training anti-government fighters, bringing social stability and public security to relevant countries. serious injury. Since a large number of such incidents are secretly manipulated by the US government, the specific damage caused by them is difficult to count.

## 2. The consequences of the war launched by the United States

#### Since World War II, almost all U.S. presidents have launched or intervened in foreign wars during their term of office. doctrine, preventing the proliferation of “weapons of mass destruction,” keeping the American diaspora safe, and more. Among them, only one was a counterattack against the direct terrorist attack on the US mainland, and the others were active foreign use of force in a context that was not directly related to the vital interests of the United States. Even this only "justifiable defense" was clearly over-defense: under the banner of "eliminating the threat of al-Qaeda", the U.S. military, in line with the principle of "would rather kill by mistake than kill by mistake," arbitrarily expanded the scope of its strikes in the war on terror. , causing a large number of local civilian casualties; even if the US military claimed to have used "relatively accurate" drone attacks, the phenomenon of indiscriminate killing of innocent people still occurred frequently.

#### Judging from the procedures followed by the United States in using force, some are launching military strikes through the "legitimate channel" authorized by the Security Council after manipulating the United Nations, but more often they leave the Security Council aside, regardless of other countries or even Against the opposition of allies, it will attack an independent sovereign country, and even provoked war abroad without the approval of the US Congress, which has the only legal right to declare war.

#### From the perspective of the consequences, the foreign war launched by the United States has caused various regional and international crises.

#### The war has directly led to humanitarian disasters in the countries concerned, including casualties, destruction of facilities, stagnation of production, and especially the casualties of a large number of innocent civilians. In the areas where the war has spread, people are dying at home, in markets, on the roads, by bombs, bullets, improvised explosive devices, drones, by US airstrikes, government raids, massacres by terrorist and extremist groups and domestic riots. According to a research report released by Brown University in November 2018, 43,074, 23,924, 184,382-207,156, 49,591, and 12,000 civilians died in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Syria, and Yemen due to wars. There were 67, 8, 277, 75, and 31 media personnel, and 424, 97, 63, 185, and 38 humanitarian aid workers died. Casualties are also often downplayed by the U.S. government. The US "Intercept" website reported on November 19, 2018 that the actual death toll of Iraqi civilians far exceeds the number officially reported by the US military.

#### War brings a series of complex social problems, including refugee flow, social unrest, ecological crisis, psychological trauma, etc. According to statistics, several wars in which the US military has been involved in recent years have resulted in a high number of refugees, such as 11 million in Afghanistan, 380,000 in Pakistan, 3.25 million in Iraq, and 12.59 million in Syria. These refugees were forced to leave their homes. About 1.3 million Afghan refugees went to Pakistan and about 900,000 went to Iran; about 3.5 million Iraqi and Syrian refugees went to Turkey, and about 1 million went to Iran. In Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan, lack of medical care, malnutrition, and environmental pollution kill far more people than are the direct casualties of war. It is estimated that the number of people who die not directly caused by war is four times as high as the number of people who die directly from war. The uranium content per kilogram of soil in Basra, Iraq soared from less than 70 becquerels before 1991 to 10,000 becquerels in 2009, and even as high as 36,205 becquerels in areas left over from war material. The British "Guardian" website reported on August 22, 2016 that the birth rate of babies with birth defects in Iraq in 2010 was as high as 30%, while this figure is only 2% to 4% under normal circumstances.

#### The war waged by the United States also had spillover effects, causing harm to countries not involved. For example, during the Vietnam War, in the name of blocking the "Ho Chi Minh Trail", the US military spread the war to neighboring countries such as Cambodia and Laos, resulting in the death and injury of more than 500,000 innocent civilians and leaving behind a large number of unexploded ordnance. During the war in Afghanistan, when US planes and drones were fighting terrorists, they often dropped bombs on neighboring Pakistani villages and injured innocent people. Even the wedding cars and Pakistani border guards were not spared. In the continuous air strikes against the Yugoslavia, the US military also targeted the Chinese embassy, ​​killing three Chinese journalists and injuring more than a dozen others.

#### The United States itself has also become a victim of its foreign wars. According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 103,284 and 153,303 Americans were physically injured in the Korean War and the Vietnam War, respectively. About one-third of the 103,788 veterans who returned from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars between 2001 and 2005 were diagnosed with a mental or psychological disorder, and 56 percent had more than one disorder. Research by the Congressional Research Service shows that between 2008 and 2016, more than 6,000 veterans committed suicide each year. The U.S. military pays more than $2.8 billion a year to veterans of the Korean War and their families, more than $22 billion a year to veterans of the Vietnam War and their families, and medical and injury payments to veterans of the Afghan War. Disability care costs have exceeded $170 billion. Business Insider reported in December 2019 that more than 3,800 U.S. civilian contractors are estimated to have died since the outbreak of the war in Afghanistan, far exceeding government statistics and even U.S. military deaths.

## 3. The humanitarian crisis stems from the hegemonic thinking of the United States

#### Looking at the many wars of aggression launched by the United States, it can be seen that there are many cases of humanitarian crises caused by its military operations. In Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and other countries where the war has not been extinguished, "accidental bombing and accidental injury" have occurred frequently, refugees have nowhere to stay, infrastructure is riddled with holes, and national production has stagnated. The wars launched by the United States abroad are often under the banner of "human rights over sovereignty" and "humanitarian intervention". Why did they eventually turn into humanitarian disasters?

#### The American "Foreign Policy" magazine in April 2011 summed up five reasons why the United States frequently uses force abroad, in addition to the fact that it is difficult to resist the temptation to resort to force due to its military superiority, and the domestic check and balance mechanism is difficult to play an effective role and other factors. Furthermore, there is no mention of what role American values ​​played in it. In fact, "upholding human rights" is not a clear driving force for the U.S. to use foreign force. It is just a means for the U.S. to achieve its own goals. Although it does not exclude the drive of morality, it is not a sufficient or necessary condition. As long as it believes it is necessary, as long as it is beneficial to itself, as long as it feels within its means, the United States will have the urge to use force. The resulting humanitarian disaster, no matter how terrifying, will always be borne by others. It will not affect the United States in achieving its goals, nor will it directly harm Americans. The choice to use force regardless of the consequences reflects the hegemonic mentality of "America first" and the strong take all, and the unilateral thinking of "self-respect, rather than the world".

#### In the eyes of American politicians who profess to respect "universal values", are the "human rights gifted to them" equally given to other people in the world?

#### Since the United States has established the law that all ethnic groups are equal, does the United States really believe that they should also enjoy the same basic rights when facing foreign people, or is it just because they do not have American votes in their hands?

#### The United States believes that terrorist attacks against civilians in its homeland are despicable and punishable, and is it acceptable and "necessary" "Sacrifice?

#### In other people's land, "would rather kill by mistake than by mistake", use radioactive weapons indiscriminately, destroy all vegetation with toxic agents, and fire at will without identifying the nature of the target. To whom are the "self-evident" human rights granted?

#### Where are the human rights of civilians who are at risk of being shot as terrorists at any time simply because they are unable to flee the fighting zone? Where are the human rights of those children who are maimed at birth by the chemical weapons of the US military and will suffer for the rest of their lives? Where are the human rights of those refugees who are fleeing the war with the U.S. military but have nowhere to go?

#### In the final analysis, there is a problem in the thinking mode of resolving disputes by means of unilateral warfare at every turn. Humanism and hegemonism are inherently antagonistic, and expecting hegemonic countries to defend the human rights of other countries is tantamount to scheming against tigers. The settlement of international disputes depends on equal consultation within the framework of the United Nations, coordination by well-regulated and well-established international mechanisms, and the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. Only by abandoning the hegemonic thinking of self-interest first can we prevent "humanitarian intervention" from turning into a humanitarian disaster, achieve mutual benefit and win-win results, and enable people of all countries to truly enjoy all basic human rights.
