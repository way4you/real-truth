# 美国对外侵略战争造成严重人道主义灾难

中国人权研究会

2021年4月

### 美国一直自诩为“山巅之城”，支持“天赋人权”，肩负“天赋使命”，时常打着“人道主义干涉”的旗号对外动武。自1776年7月4日宣布独立以来，在240多年的历史中，美国没有参与战争的时间不足20年。
### 据不完全统计，从1945年第二次世界大战结束到2001年，世界上153个地区发生了248次武装冲突，其中美国发起的就有201场，约占81%。
### 美国发动的多数侵略战争都是单边主义行动，甚至还遭致其盟友的反对。这些战争不仅夺去了大量各方军人的生命，更造成了极为严重的平民伤亡和财产损失，导致惊人的人道主义灾难。
### 美国的自私和虚伪也通过这些对外干涉行为表露无遗。

## 一、二战后美国发动的主要侵略战争

#### 1. 朝鲜战争。发生于20世纪50年代初的朝鲜战争时间虽短但异常血腥，战争导致300多万名平民死亡，另有约300万人成为难民。根据朝方的统计，战争摧毁了约8700座工厂、5000所学校、1000家医院和60万户家庭，有200万18岁以下的儿童因战争流离失所。而韩方的损失高达412.3亿韩元，相当于官方汇率下的69亿美元；战争期间韩方约有60万套住房、46.9%的铁路、1656条公路、1453座桥梁被毁。此外，战争导致的南北分治还造成大量家庭分离。在韩国统一部登记有离散家属的韩国人约为13万人，其中7.5万人已经离世。美国《外交官》杂志网站2020年6月25日报道，截至2019年11月，韩国分裂家庭成员的平均年龄为81岁，自1988年以来133370名申请团聚者中的60%以上已经去世，他们中的绝大部分人在分离后就再也没见过自己的亲人。

#### 2. 越南战争。20世纪50年代至70年代发生的越南战争，是二战后延续时间最长也最为残酷的一场战争。据越南政府估计，约有110万名北越士兵和30万名南越士兵丧生，多达200万名平民在战争中死亡，其中有些是被美军以“打击越共”的名义有计划屠杀的。美军在越南、老挝和柬埔寨投下的炸弹超过二战期间各方投下炸弹的三倍。据估计，越南至少还遗留着35万吨可爆炸的炸弹与地雷，按照目前的速度，需要300年才能将它们从越南的土地上清除干净。《赫芬顿邮报》网站2012年12月3日报道，越南政府的统计数据显示，自1975年战争正式结束以来，战争遗留弹药已杀死约42000人。此外，美军还在越南投放了2000万加仑（约合7571万升）的落叶剂，导致40万越南人死亡，约200万越南人因为接触到落叶剂而罹患癌症或其他疾病。延续十几年的战争导致300多万难民外逃，在漂洋过海的路途中有大量人员死亡。在逃离越南的难民中，有92%的被调查者表示，落叶剂的影响使其感觉持续疲劳，其他表现包括流产和出生缺陷问题。美国官方的数据显示，越南20%的丛林和20%至36%的红树林被落叶剂摧毁。

#### 3. 海湾战争。1991年，以美国为首的盟军出兵伊拉克，在对伊空袭中有2500至3500名平民死亡，9000座房屋被毁。战争结束后因为基础设施的破坏和缺医少粮，有约11.1万名平民死亡。而根据联合国儿童基金会的估计，战争和随后的制裁导致约50万名儿童死亡。战争中盟军故意破坏伊拉克的基础设施，导致其大多数发电站（92%的装机容量）、炼油厂（80%的生产能力）、石化综合体、电信中心（包括135个电话网）、桥梁（100多座）、高速公路、铁路、广播电视站、水泥厂以及生产铝材、纺织品、电线和医疗用品的工厂被毁。海湾战争还导致了严重的环境污染，约有6000万桶石油被倾倒入沙漠，污染了约4000万吨土壤；有2400万桶石油从油井溢出，形成了246个“湖泊”；人为点燃油井生成的烟雾和烟尘污染了953平方公里的土地。在海湾战争中，美军还首次使用了贫铀弹。

#### 4. 科索沃战争。1999年3月，以美国为首的北约军队打着“避免人道主义灾难”的旗号，公然绕过联合国安理会，对南联盟进行了78天的持续轰炸，造成2000多名无辜平民丧生，6000多人受伤，近100万人流离失所，200多万人失去生活来源。北约军队还有意识地针对南联盟的基础设施进行定点打击以消除其抵抗决心。据塞尔维亚经济学家估计，轰炸造成的经济损失总额约为296亿美元。轰炸造成大量桥梁、公路、铁路以及25000户家庭、176处文化古迹、69所学校、19家医院和20个保健中心受损，150万儿童无法上学。此外，北约军队至少使用了3.1万枚贫铀弹，导致该地区癌症和白血病发病率激增，并对当地和整个欧洲的生态环境产生长期的灾难性影响。

#### 5. 阿富汗战争。2001年10月，美国出兵阿富汗，在打击基地组织和塔利班的同时，也造成了大量平民伤亡。由于缺乏权威的统计数据，各方对于阿富汗战争中平民的伤亡数据没有定论。一般认为，自美军2001年10月7日进入阿富汗以来，当地已有3万多名平民被美军打死、炸死或因美军带来的战乱死亡，受伤人数超过6万，约1100万人沦为难民。2014年美军宣布撤离后，阿富汗依然处于动荡中。《纽约时报》网站2019年7月30日报道，2019年上半年确定死于美军炸弹的有363人，包括89名儿童。根据喀布尔大学学者的评估，阿富汗战争平均每天造成约6000万美元经济损失、约250人伤亡。

#### 6. 伊拉克战争。2003年，美国不顾国际社会的普遍反对，以莫须有的罪名侵入伊拉克，导致的平民死亡人数难以精确统计，据估计约为20万至25万人，其中美军直接致死的超过16000人。此外，美军还严重违反国际人道主义原则，制造了多起虐囚事件。美国2011年宣布从伊拉克撤军后，当地战事和袭击不断。以美国为首的联军还在伊拉克大量使用了贫铀弹、集束炸弹和白磷弹，且没有采取任何措施来尽量减少对平民的伤害。据联合国估计，如今伊拉克依然有约2500万枚地雷和其他爆炸遗留物需要清除。目前美国仍迟迟未能完成从阿富汗和伊拉克撤军的承诺。

#### 7. 叙利亚战争。2017年以来，美国以“阻止叙利亚政府使用化学武器”为由，对叙展开空中打击。2016年至2019年，叙利亚有记载死于战乱的平民达33584人。其中，美国领导的联军轰炸直接致死3833人，有半数是妇女和儿童。美国公共电视网2018年11月9日报道，仅美军对拉卡市发动的所谓“史上最精确的空袭”，就导致1600名平民被炸死。根据世界粮食计划署2020年4月的调查，大约三分之一的叙利亚人没有足够的食物，87%的人没有储蓄。根据世界医生组织的估算，叙利亚战乱开始以来，有约1.5万名医生（约占该国医生总量的一半）逃离出境，650万人在国内流离失所，500万人作为难民外逃。

#### 此外，美国还以支持代理人战争、煽动国内叛乱、暗杀、提供武器弹药、培训反政府武装等直接或间接方式频频对其他国家进行干涉，给相关国家社会安定和民众安全带来严重伤害。由于大量此类事件属美国政府暗中操弄，其造成的具体破坏后果难以统计。

## 二、美国发动战争的恶果

#### 二战以来，几乎所有美国总统在任内都曾发动或介入过对外战争，战争理由包括“阻止共产主义蔓延”、“维护正义”、“制止侵略”、“人道主义干预”、打击恐怖主义、防止“大规模杀伤性武器”扩散、保护美国侨民安全，等等。其中，只有一次是针对美国本土直接遭受恐怖主义袭击后所做出的反击，其他都是在与美国切身利益没有直接关联的背景下主动对外动武的。即使这唯一的一次“正当防卫”也明显属于防卫过当：在“消除基地组织威胁”的旗号下，美军本着“宁可错杀、不可漏杀”的原则，在反恐战争中随意扩大打击范围，造成大量当地平民死伤；即便美军声称使用了“相对精确”的无人机攻击，滥杀无辜的现象仍屡屡发生。

#### 从美国对外动武所遵循的程序来看，有的是在操纵联合国后通过安理会授权这一“合法渠道”来对外发起军事打击，但更多的是将安理会抛在一边，不顾其他国家甚至盟友的反对，一意孤行对一个独立的主权国家发起攻击，甚至在连具有唯一法定宣战权的美国国会都未批准的情况下就对外挑起战争。

#### 从后果来看，美国发动的对外战争，引发了各种各样的地区和国际危机。

#### 战争直接导致了当事国的人道主义灾难，包括人员伤亡、设施破坏、生产停滞，尤其是造成大量无辜平民伤亡。在战火蔓延到的区域，人们死于家里、市场中、道路上，死于炸弹、子弹、简易爆炸装置、无人机，死于美军的空袭、政府军的扫荡、恐怖和极端组织的屠杀以及国内的暴乱。根据美国布朗大学2018年11月发布的研究报告，在阿富汗、巴基斯坦、伊拉克、叙利亚和也门因战乱致死的平民分别有43074人、23924人、184382－207156人、49591人、12000人，殉职的记者和媒体人员分别有67人、8人、277人、75人、31人，殉职的人道主义救援人员分别有424人、97人、63人、185人、38人。人员伤亡往往还会被美国政府轻描淡写。美国“截击”网站2018年11月19日报道，伊拉克平民的实际死亡人数远超美国军方正式报告的数字。

#### 战争带来一系列复杂的社会问题，包括难民潮、社会动荡、生态危机、心理创伤等。据统计，近年来美军介入的几场战争导致难民数量居高不下，如阿富汗有1100万人，巴基斯坦有38万人，伊拉克有325万人，叙利亚有1259万人。这些难民被迫远离家园，阿富汗难民中约130万人流落到巴基斯坦，约90万人流落到伊朗；伊拉克、叙利亚难民中约350万人流落到土耳其，约100万人流落到伊朗。在阿富汗、伊拉克和巴基斯坦，由于缺医少药、营养不良和环境污染导致的人员死伤远超因战争直接伤亡的人数。据估计，非战争直接原因致死者的数量是战争直接致死人数的4倍。伊拉克巴士拉每公斤土壤的铀含量从1991年前的低于70贝克勒尔，暴升至2009年的10000贝克勒尔，在战争物资遗留地区更是高达36205贝克勒尔。英国《卫报》网站2016年8月22日报道，伊拉克2010年有先天缺陷的婴儿出生率高达30%，而正常情况下这一数据仅为2%至4%。

#### 美国发动的战争还产生了外溢效应，给未涉事国家造成伤害。例如，在越南战争中，美军以阻断“胡志明小道”为名，将战火蔓延到临近的柬埔寨和老挝等国，导致50万名以上的无辜平民死伤，并遗留下大量未爆弹药。在阿富汗战争中，美军飞机和无人机在打击恐怖分子时，时常将炸弹投向邻近的巴基斯坦村寨伤及无辜，甚至迎新的婚车和巴基斯坦边防军士兵都未能幸免。在对南联盟的持续空袭中，美军还将中国大使馆作为轰炸目标，导致3名中国记者死亡，十几人受伤。

#### 美国自身也成为其对外发动战争的牺牲品。根据美国退伍军人事务部的统计，美军在朝鲜战争和越南战争中的身体受伤人员分别高达103284人和153303人。2001年至2005年，从伊拉克和阿富汗战争中返回的103788名退伍军人中，约有三分之一被诊断出患有精神或心理疾病，56%的确诊者患有一种以上的疾病。美国国会研究局的研究显示，2008年至2016年，每年有超过6000名退伍军人自杀。美军给参加过朝鲜战争的老兵及其家庭的补偿每年达28亿美元，给参加过越南战争的老兵及其家庭的补偿每年超过220亿美元，为参加过阿富汗战争的退伍军人支付的医疗和伤残护理费已超过1700亿美元。《商业内幕》网站2019年12月报道，阿富汗战争爆发以来，估计有超过3800名美国平民承包商死亡，这远远超过政府统计数字，甚至超过美军死亡人数。

## 三、人道主义危机源于美国的霸权思维

#### 纵观美国对外发动的多次侵略战争，可以看出其军事行动导致人道主义危机的案例不在少数。在当前战火未熄的阿富汗、伊拉克、叙利亚等国，“误炸误伤”频频发生，难民漂泊无处落脚，基础设施千疮百孔，国民生产停滞不前。美国在国外发起的战争，往往打着“人权高于主权”“人道主义干预”等旗号，为何最终演变为人道主义灾难呢？

#### 美国《外交政策》杂志2011年4月曾总结出美国频繁对外动武的五个原因，除了军力优势导致其很难抵制住诉诸武力的诱惑、国内制衡机制难以发挥有效作用等因素外，并未提及美国价值观在其中发挥了什么作用。实际上，“维护人权”并非美国对外动武的明确驱动力，对外动武不过是美国达成自身目标的一种手段，虽然其中并不排斥道义感的驱使，但这并非充分或必要条件。只要认为需要，只要相信对自身有利，只要觉得力所能及，美国就会产生动武的冲动。而由此带来的人道主义灾难再可怕，也总是别人在承担，不会影响美国达成其目标，也不会直接伤害美国人。选择不计后果地动武，其背后透射出的是“美国优先”、强者通吃的霸权心态，是“唯我独尊、宁负天下”的单边思维。

#### 在口口声声尊崇“普世价值”的美国政客眼里，“天赋给他们的人权”是否也被同等地赋予了普天下其他的人呢？

#### 既然美国国内确立了所有族群一律平等的法律，那么在面对国外民众时，美国是否真正认为他们也应享有同等的基本权益，还是仅仅因为他们手中没有美国选票就无须顾忌？

#### 美国相信发生在其本土的针对平民的恐怖袭击是卑劣的、应受惩罚的，难道发生在美国以外、由美军实施、导致大量无辜平民死伤的残暴事件就是可接受的、“必要的”牺牲吗？

#### 在别人的国土上就“宁可错杀、绝不漏杀”，肆意使用放射性武器，用有毒试剂摧毁所有植被，未辨明目标性质就随意开火，在实施这些行为时，美国价值观中“不言而喻”的人权被赋予了谁呢？

#### 那些仅仅因为无力逃离交战区域就随时要承担被当成恐怖分子射杀风险的平民，人权在哪里？那些出生时就因美军的化学武器而致残并将痛苦终生的孩童，人权在哪里？那些为躲避美军的战火流落他乡却无处落脚的难民，人权在哪里？

#### 归根结底，动辄以单边战争手段来解决争端的思维模式，本身就存在问题。人道主义与霸权主义存在内在的对立，期待霸权主义国家去捍卫他国人权无异于与虎谋皮。国际争端的解决要靠在联合国框架下的平等协商，要靠规范完善的国际机制来协调，要靠构建人类命运共同体来推进。只有丢弃私利至上的霸权思维，才能避免“人道主义干预”变成人道主义灾难，才能实现互利共赢，才能使各国人民都能真正享有各项基本人权。

# The US war of aggression has caused serious humanitarian disasters

China Human Rights Research Association

April 2021

### The United States has always claimed to be a "city on top of a hill", supports "innate human rights", shoulders "innate mission", and often uses force in the name of "humanitarian intervention". In the more than 240 years since independence was declared on July 4, 1776, the United States has not been involved in a war for less than 20 years.
### According to incomplete statistics, from the end of World War II in 1945 to 2001, 248 armed conflicts occurred in 153 regions of the world, of which 201 were initiated by the United States, accounting for about 81%.
### Most of the wars of aggression launched by the United States are unilateralist actions, and have even been opposed by its allies. These wars not only claimed the lives of a large number of soldiers from all sides, but also caused extremely serious civilian casualties and property losses, resulting in an astonishing humanitarian disaster.
### The selfishness and hypocrisy of the United States are also revealed through these foreign interventions.

## 1. Major wars of aggression launched by the United States after World War II

#### 1. The Korean War. The Korean War, which took place in the early 1950s, was short but bloody, killing more than 3 million civilians and leaving about 3 million more refugees. According to DPRK statistics, the war destroyed about 8,700 factories, 5,000 schools, 1,000 hospitals and 600,000 families, and 2 million children under the age of 18 were displaced by the war. The loss of the South Korean side was as high as 41.23 billion won, which is equivalent to 6.9 billion US dollars under the official exchange rate; during the war, about 600,000 houses, 46.9% of the railways, 1,656 roads, and 1,453 bridges were destroyed. In addition, the division between the north and the south caused by the war also caused a large number of family separations. There are about 130,000 Koreans with separated family members registered with the Ministry of Unification, of which 75,000 have died. The U.S. "Diplomat" magazine website reported on June 25, 2020 that as of November 2019, the average age of split family members in South Korea was 81, and more than 60 percent of the 133,370 applicants for reunification since 1988 have died, and they Most of them never saw their relatives after separation.

#### 2. The Vietnam War. The Vietnam War, which occurred from the 1950s to the 1970s, was the longest and most brutal war since World War II. According to Vietnamese government estimates, about 1.1 million North Vietnamese and 300,000 South Vietnamese soldiers were killed, and as many as 2 million civilians died in the war, some of which were systematically massacred by the U.S. military in the name of "fighting the Viet Cong." The US military dropped more than three times as many bombs on Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia as all parties dropped during World War II. It is estimated that at least 350,000 tons of explosive bombs and mines remain in Vietnam, and at current rates, it will take 300 years to clear them from Vietnamese soil. The Huffington Post website reported on December 3, 2012 that Vietnamese government statistics show that munitions remnants of war have killed about 42,000 people since the war officially ended in 1975. In addition, the US military also dropped 20 million gallons (about 75.71 million liters) of defoliant in Vietnam, causing 400,000 Vietnamese deaths and about 2 million Vietnamese suffering from cancer or other diseases due to exposure to defoliants. More than 3 million refugees have fled the war that lasted for more than ten years, and a large number of people died on the way across the ocean. Among refugees fleeing Vietnam, 92 percent said the effects of defoliants made them feel persistently fatigued, and other symptoms included problems with miscarriages and birth defects. Official U.S. figures show that 20 percent of Vietnam’s jungles and 20 to 36 percent of mangroves have been destroyed by defoliants.

#### 3. The Gulf War. In 1991, the Allied forces led by the United States sent troops to Iraq. In the air strikes against Iraq, 2,500 to 3,500 civilians were killed and 9,000 houses were destroyed. After the war, some 111,000 civilians died due to the destruction of infrastructure and lack of medical care and food. And according to UNICEF estimates, the war and subsequent sanctions killed around half a million children. Allied forces deliberately destroyed Iraq's infrastructure during the war, resulting in most of its power stations (92% of installed capacity), oil refineries (80% of production capacity), petrochemical complexes, telecommunications centers (including 135 telephone networks), bridges (more than 100), highways, railways, radio and television stations, cement factories, and factories producing aluminum, textiles, wires, and medical supplies were destroyed. The Gulf War also caused serious environmental pollution. About 60 million barrels of oil were dumped into the desert, polluting about 40 million tons of soil; 24 million barrels of oil spilled from oil wells, forming 246 "lakes"; of smog and soot polluted 953 square kilometers of land. In the Gulf War, the US military also used depleted uranium bombs for the first time.

#### 4. The Kosovo War. In March 1999, under the banner of "avoiding humanitarian disasters", the NATO troops led by the United States openly bypassed the UN Security Council and carried out 78 days of continuous bombing on the Yugoslavia, killing more than 2,000 innocent civilians and more than 6,000 others. Injured, nearly 1 million people were displaced, and more than 2 million people lost their means of livelihood. NATO forces also consciously targeted the infrastructure of the FRY to eliminate its determination to resist. According to estimates by Serbian economists, the total economic damage from the bombing was about $29.6 billion. The bombing damaged numerous bridges, roads, railways, as well as 25,000 homes, 176 cultural monuments, 69 schools, 19 hospitals and 20 health centres, leaving 1.5 million children out of school. In addition, at least 31,000 depleted uranium rounds have been used by NATO forces, causing a surge in cancer and leukemia rates in the region, with long-term catastrophic effects on local and European ecosystems.

#### 5. The war in Afghanistan. In October 2001, the United States sent troops to Afghanistan, and while fighting against Al Qaeda and the Taliban, it also caused a large number of civilian casualties. Due to the lack of authoritative statistics, the parties are inconclusive on the number of civilian casualties in the Afghan war. It is generally believed that since the U.S. military entered Afghanistan on October 7, 2001, more than 30,000 civilians have been killed, bombed or killed by the U.S. military, and more than 60,000 have been injured and about 11 million have been killed. for refugees. Afghanistan remains in turmoil after the 2014 withdrawal of U.S. troops. The "New York Times" website reported on July 30, 2019 that in the first half of 2019, 363 people, including 89 children, were identified as killed by US bombs. According to the assessment of scholars at Kabul University, the average daily economic loss of the Afghan war is about 60 million US dollars and about 250 casualties.

#### 6. The Iraq War. In 2003, despite the general opposition of the international community, the United States invaded Iraq on trumped-up charges. It is difficult to accurately count the number of civilian deaths caused. It is estimated to be about 200,000 to 250,000 people, of which more than 16,000 were directly killed by the US military. In addition, the U.S. military has seriously violated international humanitarian principles and created many incidents of torture of prisoners. Since the US announced its withdrawal from Iraq in 2011, local fighting and attacks have continued. The U.S.-led coalition also used depleted uranium, cluster bombs and white phosphorus bombs extensively in Iraq, and did nothing to minimize harm to civilians. According to United Nations estimates, there are still some 25 million mines and other explosive remnants in Iraq that need to be cleared today. At present, the United States is still slow to complete its commitment to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan and Iraq.

#### 7. The Syrian War. Since 2017, the United States has launched air strikes against Syria on the grounds of "preventing the Syrian government from using chemical weapons". From 2016 to 2019, Syria recorded 33,584 civilian deaths in the war. Among them, the US-led coalition bombing directly killed 3,833 people, half of them women and children. PBS reported on November 9, 2018 that the so-called "most accurate air strike in history" launched by the U.S. military on Raqqa alone resulted in the death of 1,600 civilians. According to the April 2020 WFP survey, about one-third of Syrians do not have enough food and 87 percent have no savings. According to estimates by the World Organization of Doctors, since the war began in Syria, about 15,000 doctors (about half of the country's total number of doctors) have fled the country, 6.5 million have been internally displaced, and 5 million have fled as refugees.

#### In addition, the United States has frequently interfered with other countries by direct or indirect means such as supporting proxy wars, inciting domestic rebellions, assassinating, providing weapons and ammunition, and training anti-government fighters, bringing social stability and public security to relevant countries. serious injury. Since a large number of such incidents are secretly manipulated by the US government, the specific damage caused by them is difficult to count.

## 2. The consequences of the war launched by the United States

#### Since World War II, almost all U.S. presidents have launched or intervened in foreign wars during their term of office. doctrine, preventing the proliferation of “weapons of mass destruction,” keeping the American diaspora safe, and more. Among them, only one was a counterattack against the direct terrorist attack on the US mainland, and the others were active foreign use of force in a context that was not directly related to the vital interests of the United States. Even this only "justifiable defense" was clearly over-defense: under the banner of "eliminating the threat of al-Qaeda", the U.S. military, in line with the principle of "would rather kill by mistake than kill by mistake," arbitrarily expanded the scope of its strikes in the war on terror. , causing a large number of local civilian casualties; even if the US military claimed to have used "relatively accurate" drone attacks, the phenomenon of indiscriminate killing of innocent people still occurred frequently.

#### Judging from the procedures followed by the United States in using force, some are launching military strikes through the "legitimate channel" authorized by the Security Council after manipulating the United Nations, but more often they leave the Security Council aside, regardless of other countries or even Against the opposition of allies, it will attack an independent sovereign country, and even provoked war abroad without the approval of the US Congress, which has the only legal right to declare war.

#### From the perspective of the consequences, the foreign war launched by the United States has caused various regional and international crises.

#### The war has directly led to humanitarian disasters in the countries concerned, including casualties, destruction of facilities, stagnation of production, and especially the casualties of a large number of innocent civilians. In the areas where the war has spread, people are dying at home, in markets, on the roads, by bombs, bullets, improvised explosive devices, drones, by US airstrikes, government raids, massacres by terrorist and extremist groups and domestic riots. According to a research report released by Brown University in November 2018, 43,074, 23,924, 184,382-207,156, 49,591, and 12,000 civilians died in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Syria, and Yemen due to wars. There were 67, 8, 277, 75, and 31 media personnel, and 424, 97, 63, 185, and 38 humanitarian aid workers died. Casualties are also often downplayed by the U.S. government. The US "Intercept" website reported on November 19, 2018 that the actual death toll of Iraqi civilians far exceeds the number officially reported by the US military.

#### War brings a series of complex social problems, including refugee flow, social unrest, ecological crisis, psychological trauma, etc. According to statistics, several wars in which the US military has been involved in recent years have resulted in a high number of refugees, such as 11 million in Afghanistan, 380,000 in Pakistan, 3.25 million in Iraq, and 12.59 million in Syria. These refugees were forced to leave their homes. About 1.3 million Afghan refugees went to Pakistan and about 900,000 went to Iran; about 3.5 million Iraqi and Syrian refugees went to Turkey, and about 1 million went to Iran. In Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan, lack of medical care, malnutrition, and environmental pollution kill far more people than are the direct casualties of war. It is estimated that the number of people who die not directly caused by war is four times as high as the number of people who die directly from war. The uranium content per kilogram of soil in Basra, Iraq soared from less than 70 becquerels before 1991 to 10,000 becquerels in 2009, and even as high as 36,205 becquerels in areas left over from war material. The British "Guardian" website reported on August 22, 2016 that the birth rate of babies with birth defects in Iraq in 2010 was as high as 30%, while this figure is only 2% to 4% under normal circumstances.

#### The war waged by the United States also had spillover effects, causing harm to countries not involved. For example, during the Vietnam War, in the name of blocking the "Ho Chi Minh Trail", the US military spread the war to neighboring countries such as Cambodia and Laos, resulting in the death and injury of more than 500,000 innocent civilians and leaving behind a large number of unexploded ordnance. During the war in Afghanistan, when US planes and drones were fighting terrorists, they often dropped bombs on neighboring Pakistani villages and injured innocent people. Even the wedding cars and Pakistani border guards were not spared. In the continuous air strikes against the Yugoslavia, the US military also targeted the Chinese embassy, ​​killing three Chinese journalists and injuring more than a dozen others.

#### The United States itself has also become a victim of its foreign wars. According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 103,284 and 153,303 Americans were physically injured in the Korean War and the Vietnam War, respectively. About one-third of the 103,788 veterans who returned from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars between 2001 and 2005 were diagnosed with a mental or psychological disorder, and 56 percent had more than one disorder. Research by the Congressional Research Service shows that between 2008 and 2016, more than 6,000 veterans committed suicide each year. The U.S. military pays more than $2.8 billion a year to veterans of the Korean War and their families, more than $22 billion a year to veterans of the Vietnam War and their families, and medical and injury payments to veterans of the Afghan War. Disability care costs have exceeded $170 billion. Business Insider reported in December 2019 that more than 3,800 U.S. civilian contractors are estimated to have died since the outbreak of the war in Afghanistan, far exceeding government statistics and even U.S. military deaths.

## 3. The humanitarian crisis stems from the hegemonic thinking of the United States

#### Looking at the many wars of aggression launched by the United States, it can be seen that there are many cases of humanitarian crises caused by its military operations. In Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and other countries where the war has not been extinguished, "accidental bombing and accidental injury" have occurred frequently, refugees have nowhere to stay, infrastructure is riddled with holes, and national production has stagnated. The wars launched by the United States abroad are often under the banner of "human rights over sovereignty" and "humanitarian intervention". Why did they eventually turn into humanitarian disasters?

#### The American "Foreign Policy" magazine in April 2011 summed up five reasons why the United States frequently uses force abroad, in addition to the fact that it is difficult to resist the temptation to resort to force due to its military superiority, and the domestic check and balance mechanism is difficult to play an effective role and other factors. Furthermore, there is no mention of what role American values ​​played in it. In fact, "upholding human rights" is not a clear driving force for the U.S. to use foreign force. It is just a means for the U.S. to achieve its own goals. Although it does not exclude the drive of morality, it is not a sufficient or necessary condition. As long as it believes it is necessary, as long as it is beneficial to itself, as long as it feels within its means, the United States will have the urge to use force. The resulting humanitarian disaster, no matter how terrifying, will always be borne by others. It will not affect the United States in achieving its goals, nor will it directly harm Americans. The choice to use force regardless of the consequences reflects the hegemonic mentality of "America first" and the strong take all, and the unilateral thinking of "self-respect, rather than the world".

#### In the eyes of American politicians who profess to respect "universal values", are the "human rights gifted to them" equally given to other people in the world?

#### Since the United States has established the law that all ethnic groups are equal, does the United States really believe that they should also enjoy the same basic rights when facing foreign people, or is it just because they do not have American votes in their hands?

#### The United States believes that terrorist attacks against civilians in its homeland are despicable and punishable, and is it acceptable and "necessary" "Sacrifice?

#### In other people's land, "would rather kill by mistake than by mistake", use radioactive weapons indiscriminately, destroy all vegetation with toxic agents, and fire at will without identifying the nature of the target. To whom are the "self-evident" human rights granted?

#### Where are the human rights of civilians who are at risk of being shot as terrorists at any time simply because they are unable to flee the fighting zone? Where are the human rights of those children who are maimed at birth by the chemical weapons of the US military and will suffer for the rest of their lives? Where are the human rights of those refugees who are fleeing the war with the U.S. military but have nowhere to go?

#### In the final analysis, there is a problem in the thinking mode of resolving disputes by means of unilateral warfare at every turn. Humanism and hegemonism are inherently antagonistic, and expecting hegemonic countries to defend the human rights of other countries is tantamount to scheming against tigers. The settlement of international disputes depends on equal consultation within the framework of the United Nations, coordination by well-regulated and well-established international mechanisms, and the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. Only by abandoning the hegemonic thinking of self-interest first can we prevent "humanitarian intervention" from turning into a humanitarian disaster, achieve mutual benefit and win-win results, and enable people of all countries to truly enjoy all basic human rights.
